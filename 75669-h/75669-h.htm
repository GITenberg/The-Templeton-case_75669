<h2>CHAPTER I. <br> Reginald Templeton Comes to Marsh Quay</h2>

<p>Tom Gale leaned heavily on the low bulwarks
of the little schooner <i>Lucy</i>, his arms folded upon the
aforesaid bulwarks, his short, black clay pipe in
his mouth, and his eyes fixed on the flowing tide
glittering in the sunlight of a clear October day.</p>

<p>Tom Gale had nothing whatever to do, and was
doing it well, lounging and thinking, for the most
part, about nothing at all. He combined the offices
of crew and cook of the little coasting schooner
that was moored at the head of Marsh Quay, waiting
for a load of gravel that was delayed. That very
morning word had been brought that the contractor
would not be able to cart the gravel from the pit,
about three miles away, down to Marsh Quay until
the following Tuesday. This was Saturday, and the
“captain” and “mate” had incontinently taken themselves
off to their respective homes at Frattenbury,
leaving Tom Gale in charge.</p>

<p>Tom Gale did not in the least mind having nothing
to do beyond taking care of a vessel that nobody
was likely to run away with. There was good beer
to be had at the “Mariner’s Arms,” not a hundred
yards away, and there was a nice snug bar parlour
in the “Mariner’s Arms,” where the evenings might
be spent in comfort—for there was no risk in
deserting the vessel for an hour or two.</p>

<p>Marsh Quay was on one of the little estuaries of
the sea that pierced into the southern country from
the Channel. Two miles northward, the grey, tapering
spire of the Cathedral of Frattenbury stood out
against the background of Downs and blue sky.
The estuary, which ran up within a mile of
Frattenbury to the westward, was at Marsh Quay only
about two hundred yards in width, but broadened
out southward until a curve hid its course towards
the open sea.</p>

<p>Marsh Quay, as its name implied, was a little
quay jutting out into the estuary from the eastern
shore. It was only about fifty yards long, but fairly
broad, and contained sheds for storage on either
side, except at the end, where it was quite open for
a space, which formed room for a small vessel to be
moored on either side, as well as one at its extremity.</p>

<p>The quay was reached by a straight road of about
half a mile, which turned out of the main road to
Frattenbury, and ended abruptly on the quay itself.
As one approached by this road one passed a few
cottages on either side, while, just before one came
to the quay itself, there was a good-sized house on
the right, and the “Mariner’s Arms” on the left.
The seaward wall of the little inn was washed at the
base at spring tides, and the windows looked out
over the estuary.</p>

<p>On the right-hand side of the quay, screened by
the buildings on it, was an anchorage for vessels of
small draught at low tide. A couple of little yachts
were riding here, while, drawn up on the shore, were
two or three flat-bottomed light canoes and some
small boats. Most of these belonged to the
“Mariner’s Arms,” and were for hire, Marsh Quay
being quite a little resort at high tide in summer,
when Frattenbury people came out to fish, or to
sail in the estuary.</p>

<p>On the shore immediately opposite was a wood,
coming right down to the water’s edge, already
turning golden yellow with autumn tints. Above the
trees of this wood, a few hundred yards inland, could
be seen the upper part of a house to which a boat,
moored to the tiny jetty opposite, evidently belonged.</p>

<p>At low tide the estuary was a wide expanse of
black mud, except for a narrow channel winding in
the middle, and the little pool beside the quay, which
formed the anchorage. The tide from the Channel
outside came in with a strong current which rushed
back at the turn. Boating was not particularly safe,
and even if one were sailing a light draught yacht,
one had to know the shallows well, while heavier
vessels coming up or going down with the tide had
to stick to the mid-channel, to avoid running on the
mud.</p>

<p>The <i>Lucy</i> was moored at the end of the quay,
her bows pointing southward. It was almost high
tide, still coming in, with only the vestige of a breeze
from the south-west. As Tom, Gale gazed vacantly
over the sparkling waters, a speck of white appeared,
coming into view round the bend. His seaman’s
interest was aroused. Slowly he stretched himself
into an upright position, and shaded his eyes with
his hand.</p>

<p>Presently he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>“ ’Tain’t the first time he’s come up. Knows his
way about, or he wouldn’t ha’ steered off the point
there.”</p>

<p>The speck of white grew more distinct, evolving
into the mainsail, foresail, and jib of a small,
cutter-rigged yacht. She was making little more than
tide-way, her sails every now and then flapping as the
breeze dropped.</p>

<p>Tom Gale took a look round. The water was
flowing by more slowly, the floating bits of seaweed
hardly moving now.</p>

<p>“Reckon he can’t do it,” he said. “There ’ent
wind enough to bring him up against this tide and
it’s almost on the ebb now.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, the foresail came down with a
run, followed by the jib. Then the mainsail slowly
descended.</p>

<p>“What’s he up to?” said Tom Gale. “Don’t seem
to know his way about arter all. If he drops anchor
there he’ll drag for a certainty and get on the mud.
Much better ha’ slipped back to Langham on the
tide. Ah—I see.”</p>

<p>For the yacht suddenly began to forge ahead,
while a faint succession of thudding sounds came
over the water.</p>

<p>“One of them auxiliary oil engines, that’s it.”</p>

<p>Gathering speed, the yacht came up the estuary,
stemming the outflowing tide. Tom Gale could see
two men on her now, one steering and the other
stowing the sails.</p>

<p>Presently she came up near the quay, slowing
down a bit, and Tom Gale, looking down, could
make out both men plainly. The one engaged in
stowing the sails had moved forward and was getting
the anchor ready. He was evidently a sailor, and
wore dark blue trousers and a jersey, with a peaked
cap on his head. The other was a man who looked
about fifty years of age, with moustache and short,
iron-grey beard. His face was much tanned by
exposure to weather. He wore dark trousers, a
short reefer jacket, and a yachtsman’s cap was tilted
on the back of his head. As he passed beneath the
schooner he looked up, caught Tom’s eye, and
shouted:</p>

<p>“Plenty of room round the quay?”</p>

<p>“Plenty o’ room, sir,” answered Tom, “but stand
out a bit to get round—it’s runnin’ a smart pace.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” the other shouted back, with the
air of one who was familiar with the estuary.</p>

<p>Tom Gale slowly paced the deck of the schooner
to get a better view aft. He watched the little craft
draw up to her anchorage; she was a smart little
boat, painted white, with a green line round her just
below the bulwarks, and Tom’s practised eye saw
that she had been painted quite recently. Abaft
the raised cabin was a well, in which the steersman
sat and controlled the engine, and the entrance to
this cabin the doors of which were open, was from
this well. Forward was a forecastle, evidently
providing just room for a solitary “crew.”</p>

<p>Tom Gale watched her as she came to her anchorage.
In this pool, cut off, as it were, by the side of
the quay, the water was scarcely affected by the flow
of the tide. There was a splash as the anchor was
heaved overboard, a rattle of the chain, and the
yacht slowly swung to her moorings.</p>

<p>The interest dwindled. Tom Gale pulled out a
big silver watch. It was one o’clock.</p>

<p>“Time for a pint, I reckon,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Slowly and heavily he climbed over the bulwarks
and walked along the quay to the “Mariner’s Arms.”
A stout, pleasant-looking, rosy-cheeked woman was
standing behind the little bar, polishing glasses. To
her he nodded with the air of an old acquaintance,
kept up by frequent visitations.</p>

<p>“Gimme a pint, please, missus.”</p>

<p>She drew it out of a big cask that stood on trestles
behind the bar.</p>

<p>“Weather keeps fine.”</p>

<p>“Ah—not much to grumble at,” he replied as he
counted out coppers. “Anyone in the parlour?”</p>

<p>“Only the gentleman that’s staying here.”</p>

<p>“Who’s he?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Dunno. An artist. Leastways, he does a bit o’
paintin’—and fishin’ too,” she added. “Been with
me nearly a week now. Nice quiet young man.
Don’t give no trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a look at ’im.”</p>

<p>“Ah, do.”</p>

<p>Tom Gale moved across the bar, opened a door,
and passed into the parlour that overlooked the
estuary. As has been said, the bar parlour of the
“Mariner’s Arms” was snug and cosy. Also it was
in harmony with its name and surroundings. Five
models of ships stood on the broad mantelpiece, and
the pictures consisted of oleographs of the departure
of Nelson from Portsmouth Hard on his last voyage,
his death at Trafalgar, and three or four ocean liners,
and a brigantine under full canvas sailing on an
impossible blue sea. The furniture was homely but
solid, and a comfortable settee stretched along one
side of the room.</p>

<p>Seated near the window, his unfinished glass of
beer on the table by his side, was a young man of
about five and twenty, smoking a cigar. He was
clean-shaven, with fair hair rather inclined to curl,
a firm, strong mouth, and clear blue eyes. He was
dressed in a loose knickerbocker suit, and was
wearing a soft turned-down collar.</p>

<p>Tom Gale touched his cap, and then awkwardly
removed it as he sat down and put his mug of beer
on the table.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good afternoon.”</p>

<p>Tom Gale took a long pull at his beer. He was a
sociable man.</p>

<p>“Nice weather, sir.”</p>

<p>“It is, very.”</p>

<p>“Doin’ a bit of fishing, Mrs. Yates tells me.”</p>

<p>The young man flicked the ash off his cigar, and
smiled.</p>

<p>“Trying to,” he said, “but I haven’t had any
particular luck, so far.”</p>

<p>Tom Gale thereupon waxed garrulous on the
subject. He knew the estuary well and was up to
all kinds of fishing dodges. From fishing the
conversation turned to sailing, and from sailing narrowed
down to the yacht that had just anchored.</p>

<p>“Did you see her, sir?”</p>

<p>“I was watching her just now, before you came
in.”</p>

<p>“Little beauty, I call her. I reckon she could
give points to a few in a smart breeze. Looks to
me like one o’ they Cowes boats. Never seen her
up here before, but the skipper knowed the way
right enough. ’Tain’t the first time he’s run up
to Marsh Quay, I’ll ’low. Handled her just right.”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>you</em> ought to know,” said the other with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“Ah—reckon I does. Though I ain’t had no
chance o’ sailin’ a beauty like that. Nice thing to
have nothin’ to do, and a craft like her to do it in.
One o’ these here rich chaps, I expects, what can
afford to live in luxury and have their wine and
whisky and cigars whenever they pleases.”</p>

<p>The young man had just drawn out his case, and
was selecting a fresh cigar as Tom was speaking.
He held out his case with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t be jealous of his cigars,” he said; “have
one of mine, if you like ’em.”</p>

<p>“Thank ’ee, sir. I don’t mind if I do. Not that
I often smokes one—don’t get the chance.”</p>

<p>He took out a knife, opened it, and was about to
cut the cigar, then hesitated.</p>

<p>“I’ll save it till to-morrow, if you don’t mind, sir.
I always reckon a cigar’s a Sunday smoke.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the other, as he removed the
band from his own cigar and threw it in the grate.
The fire was ready laid, but the weather was warm
and it had not been lighted.</p>

<p>Tom Gale stowed away his cigar in his pocket,
drained his mug, and glanced out of the window.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” he said, “they’re coming ashore.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Gentleman from the yacht—and his man.”</p>

<p>From the window they could see the yacht. A
little dinghy was coming ashore, pulled by the sailor.
As the bows grated on the stones he sprang out,
took a bundle from the boat, waited till the other
had moved into his seat and taken the oars, and
then shoved her off again.</p>

<p>“Skipper gone back to the yacht,” said Tom, who
was still watching. “T’other coming along for a
drink—if I knows a sailor man rightly.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the said sailor man entered the
parlour, a mug of beer in his hand.</p>

<p>“What cheer, mate! Good day, sir,” as he caught
sight of the other.</p>

<p>The two men of a trade quickly forgathered
together, while the other quietly smoked his cigar
and now and then put in a word.</p>

<p>“Stroke o’ luck for me,” said the newcomer, with
all the open frankness of his calling. “I ain’t been
this way this three year or more. Got an old uncle
living over at Frattenbury, and the skipper’s given
me the night off to go and see him. Got to get back
early to-morrow to get his breakfast for him.”</p>

<p>“What, does he sleep aboard?” asked Tom Gale.</p>

<p>“Always, ever since I’ve been with him, and that’s
gettin’ on for three weeks now. Don’t like hotels,
he says. Ain’t been used to ’em. Been livin’ up
country in Africa or somewhere—explorer cove,
seemingly. Knows his way about.”</p>

<p>“How long is he puttin’ in here?”</p>

<p>“Three or four days, I reckon. Knows
Frattenbury; got a relative there, I think.”</p>

<p>“How about his dinner to-night?” asked the young
man. “Is he seeing to it himself?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Goin’ to walk into Frattenbury
presently and have it there, he says. Comin’ back
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Got a soft job, ain’t ye?” asked Tom Gale with
a broad grin.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t bad. But he’s mighty particular.”</p>

<p>“Where did you pick him up?”</p>

<p>“Why, he only landed at Plymouth a month ago;
came straight on to Salcombe for yachtin’—mad on
it. My governor there hired him the boat and picked
me out to see to him. We’ve been runnin’ along the
coast, putting in at Dartmouth, Weymouth, and
Poole. Left Ryde early this mornin’, then the wind
dropped. Ah, he ain’t a bad sort, ain’t Mr.
Templeton.”</p>

<p>And he buried his face in his mug, and then
wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>The young man leaned forward a little in his
chair.</p>

<p>“Did you say his name was Templeton?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“That’s right, sir; Mr. Reginald Templeton. It’s
painted on one of his trunks.”</p>

<p>“And he came from Africa?”</p>

<p>“That’s correct sir.”</p>

<p>“And he’s staying here several days?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Well, I must be off. Good afternoon,
sir. Come into the bar and have one with me afore
I go,” he went on to Tom Gale.</p>

<p>The latter obeyed the call with ponderous alacrity.
The young man remained smoking thoughtfully.
Presently the landlady came in to clear away the
mugs from the table.</p>

<p>“Lor’ sir,” she said, “ain’t you goin’ out paintin’
this beautiful afternoon?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m not in the mood,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, why don’t you try a bit o’ fishin’?
There’s whitin’ to be caught off the quay head when
the tide’s ebbin’. And you’d get a bit o’ bait off
of Harry Turner, the second cottage down the road.
I know he’s got some.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mrs. Yates, I’m going up to my
room. I’ve some letters to write.”</p>

<p>His bedroom was over the bar parlour. When he
reached it he looked out of the window.</p>

<p>He took a pipe from his pocket, filled and lighted
it. But he seemed to have forgotten his letters.
Instead of writing, he sat by the window, carefully
watching to see if Mr. Templeton came ashore.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II. <br> The Visit to the Opposite Shore</h2>

<p>Tom Gale, with the comfortable sensation of the
replenishment of his inner man with a double portion
of his favourite beverage, went back on board
the <i>Lucy</i> and resumed his attitude of leaning over
the bulwarks and gazing upon the estuary. Only,
this time, he was aft of the schooner instead of
forward.</p>

<p>The tide had gone down rapidly, and great patches
of slimy black mud were showing on either side of
the central current. Opposite, just southward of
the small landing-stage where the boat was moored,
a stony patch ran out into the estuary, banking up
the water on the northern side. This made it possible,
except at extreme low water, to cross in a small
boat from shore to shore without running on the mud.</p>

<p>As Tom Gale puffed at his short pipe he was
attracted by a noise from the yacht. Looking
towards it, he observed that Templeton was hauling
the dinghy alongside.</p>

<p>“Goin’ ashore,” murmured Tom.</p>

<p>Templeton got into the dinghy, cast her off,
took the oars, and began rowing across the estuary.
To do this he had to head the boat diagonally
upstream and to pull with all his might athwart
the current. Slowly he crossed over, Tom Gale
grunting approval, till he reached the little pool
of comparatively calm water formed by the stony
patch. Here he got out, took the anchor, hitched
it round a big stone, and shoved off the boat to the
full length of her painter. Then he walked briskly
up the shore and disappeared into the
wood—towards the house.</p>

<p>The young man watching from the window of the
“Mariner’s Arms” had seen Templeton cross over.</p>

<p>He put on his hat, came downstairs and strolled
out on the quay. Then he stepped aboard the
<i>Lucy</i>, and began to talk to Tom Gale.</p>

<p>Presently he asked, nonchalantly:</p>

<p>“Who lives in that house beyond the trees
yonder?” pointing to the opposite shore.</p>

<p>Tom Gale, who had been up and down the
estuary scores of times, and was a confirmed gossip,
answered readily:</p>

<p>“Over there? Oh, he’s a London chap. Name
o’ Moss—Isaac Moss. He’s a Jew, so they say.”</p>

<p>“Ont-of-the-way place, eh?”</p>

<p>“He only comes down for week-ends. That’s his
craft—yonder,” and he nodded towards one of the
little yachts lying near the newcomer. “Has to
keep her over this side, but rows across when he
wants her. She’s stowed for the winter now, I
reckon. Lord, <em>he</em> can’t sail her, sir. Has a man to
do it for him.”</p>

<p>“What is he?”</p>

<p>“Dunno. Something up in London. Reg’lar Jew,
sir. Come walkin’ out from Frattenbury one
Saturday I was here—his motor had gone wrong, and
couldn’t run in to fetch him. Asked me to pull
him across when a smartish tide was runnin’, and
give me thruppence for it. Look—that’s him,” and
he pointed to the other side, where two men were
coming out of the wood to the shore. “T’other’s
the skipper comin’ back I reckon.”</p>

<p>Templeton, for it was he, drew the dinghy ashore,
stepped into her, and began to row across. The
other, a small man, stood on the shore, apparently
still talking to him.</p>

<p>The young man, who had been sitting on the bulwarks,
rose, left the schooner, and walked back to
the inn. From the window he again took up his
watch. This time he was successful. Templeton,
having boarded his yacht for a few minutes, pulled
himself ashore, dragged the dinghy a little way out
of the water and made her painter fast to a stump
of wood. Then he began walking briskly over the
field path that led to Frattenbury.</p>

<p>By this time it was well on in the afternoon.
The young man came down, had his tea, and then
strolled out. For some time he stood at the entrance
to the quay looking at the yacht. The latter was
only about twenty yards from the shore, and he
could clearly make out the name on her
bows—the <i>Firefly</i>.</p>

<p>Later on Tom Gale found a little company
assembled in the bar parlour, and spent a pleasant,
and somewhat beery, evening. At ten o’clock
Mrs. Yates gently but firmly turned them all out.
The little group stood talking for a few minutes in
the road, and then separated. The night was very
dark, but Tom Gale was accustomed to dark nights
at sea. Mechanically observant, he could make out
the dim shape of the dinghy, already half afloat on
the flowing tide, while the outline of the yacht, riding
at anchor, was just discernible. There were no
lights showing on it.</p>

<p>“Skipper ain’t come back yet; he’ll have a dark,
lonesome kind o’ walk from Frattenbury,” he said
to himself as he made his way along the quay.
Arrived on board the <i>Lucy</i>, he dived into the
forecastle, lighted a candle, closed the hatch—he liked
fuggy surroundings—removed his jacket, guernsey
and trousers, rolled into his bunk, blew out the
light, and in a few minutes was sleeping the heavy
sleep of the saturated.</p>

<p>The tide rippled up the estuary. The lights in
the “Mariner’s Arms” and the cluster of cottages
went out. Marsh Quay and its surroundings were
still and quiet in the calm autumn night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III. <br> A Terrible Discovery</h2>

<p>Jim Webb, “crew” of the yacht <i>Firefly</i>, came
walking briskly over the fields from Frattenbury the
next morning. In the clear autumn air he heard
the Cathedral chimes strike the half-hour, and
compared the time with his watch. Half-past seven.
His skipper breakfasted at half-past eight, so there
was plenty of time for him to prepare the meal with
the help of the little oil-stove in his cuddy.</p>

<p>It was only a few minutes later when he reached
Marsh Quay. Mrs. Yates, who was standing at the
open door of the “Mariner’s Arms,” greeted him
with a “Good morning,” which he returned.</p>

<p>The tide was out and the yacht rode at anchor in
calm water. Moored to her stern was her dinghy,
and Webb had to get aboard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates, who was a good-natured woman, had
come out of the inn and strolled down to where he
was standing by the water’s edge.</p>

<p>“You’ll be getting your master’s breakfast, I
suppose,” she said. “If you want any hot water, I’ve
got a kettle on the fire.”</p>

<p>“Thankee kindly, missis, but there’s a stove
abord. Tell you what, though, I’ll have to borrow
one of these punts. I suppose that’ll be all right?”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome. These here belong to me, and
a nuisance they are at times. The boys will get
playing about with them. Look here—they’ve been
at it again, the young rascals! I know this one was
tied up all right yesterday.” And she pointed to
one which was unsecured to a post. “Them boys
are the plague of my life,” she went on, as Webb
dragged the little craft down to the water and
shoved off.</p>

<p>She stood, arms akimbo, watching him as he
paddled the few strokes that brought him to the
yacht. As he clambered aboard he waved his hand
to her, and at that moment he noticed behind her
the young man who had been in the bar parlour the
previous evening push a bicycle, with a stuffed holdall
strapped to it, and go quickly riding away along
the road.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates still stood looking out over the great
expanse of mud that characterised the estuary at
low tide. It was a pleasant morning, and she had
nothing particular to do just then.</p>

<p>Turning, she stopped for a minute or two to
tighten the painter of one of the other boats, and
then began to walk slowly back to her house.
Suddenly she stopped. A hoarse cry rang out over the
water behind her. Turning once more, she saw
Webb frantically climbing from the yacht into the
canoe, shouting incoherently as he did so.</p>

<p>She ran to the shore to meet him as he landed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Him—Mr. Templeton!” he cried as he staggered
ashore.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Dead!”</p>

<p>“<em>Dead?</em> What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes—dead! I found him lying there in the
cabin—on the floor.”</p>

<p>“But—but—surely——”</p>

<p>“I tell you he’s dead!” cried the man; “and
what’s more, he’s been murdered!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!” ejaculated Mrs. Yates, sitting
down on one of the posts. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“What I say. The cabin door was open, but I
didn’t take no notice o’ that. He always sleeps
with plenty o’ fresh air about. At first I thought
he’d tumbled out of his bunk and stunned himself—till
I saw something else on the floor—blood it was,
missis. Then I took a closer look at him, and saw
he was stone dead! Lyin’ on his face, he is—and
the blood all round him.”</p>

<p>“Where—whereabouts was he hurt?”</p>

<p>“I dunno; I never stayed to see. What be I
to do, missis? This is a case for the police, and——”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What is a case for the
police?”</p>

<p>They turned quickly. Coming out of the garden
gate of the house opposite the “Mariner’s Arms”
was a little elderly man, with a perfectly bald head
and clean-shaven face, like an egg. He was dressed
in a loose velveteen jacket and grey flannel trousers,
and wore a gaudy pair of woollen slippers.</p>

<p>“What the matter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Proctor!” almost screamed Mrs. Yates,
“I’m so glad you’ve come. It’s murder, sir!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Templeton, sir,” cried Webb; “he’s been
done to death—over there—on the yacht. I’ve just
found him——”</p>

<p>“Steady, my man, steady. Try and keep calm
and tell me all about it. If it’s what you say, there’s
no time to be lost.”</p>

<p>Under the quieting influence of the old
gentleman, Jim Webb retold his ghastly story; Mr.
Proctor pursing up his little round mouth, nodding
encouragingly and now and then helping him out
with a word or a question. Then he took complete
command of the case.</p>

<p>“Someone must go to Frattenbury at once and
tell the police, and bring a doctor.”</p>

<p>“There’s the young man what’s lodging with
me—Mr. Grayson,” exclaimed the landlady. “He’s
just ridin’ his bicycle into Frattenbury.”</p>

<p>“He’s gone,” said Webb. “I seen him go just as
I was gettin’ aboard.”</p>

<p>“Gone!” cried Mrs. Yates, “and never said
good-bye to me?”</p>

<p>“What,” said Mr. Proctor, “is he leaving for
good?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. All of a sudden like. Came down an
hour earlier for his breakfast and asked for his bill.
I couldn’t make it out.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” replied Mr. Proctor. “Time enough
to talk about him later. My young great-nephew is
staying with me, and he’s got a bicycle. I’ll send
him into Frattenbury at once. He’s a sharp lad.
Phil,” he cried, turning to the house, “Phil, come
here at once. Look sharp.”</p>

<p>A bright-looking boy of about fifteen came running
up. Mr. Proctor gave him hasty instructions.
“Ride as hard as you can,” he said.</p>

<p>“Righto, uncle. I’ll do it in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Good boy. Now, my man are you quite
certain your master is dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—there ain’t no doubt about it.”</p>

<p>“Um—all the same, I’ll go and have a look. You
can pull me out.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates waited on the shore till he returned,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt about it, I’m afraid. We
can’t do any more. I haven’t moved anything.
Best let the police find things just as they are. You
two come into my house and have something.
You’re both scared, that’s what you are.”</p>

<p>He took them in and gave them a brandy and
soda each. When they came out again the news
spread rapidly, and a group of men, women and
children gathered on the shore and gazed at the
yacht. Tom Gale came along the quay, munching
the remains of his breakfast. Mr. Proctor nudged
Jim Webb’s arm just as the latter was about to
tell the story to an expectant audience.</p>

<p>“If you’ll take my advice, my man,” he said,
“you’ll say nothing. Wait till the police come, and
let them take the lead.”</p>

<p>Jim Webb accordingly lighted his pipe and
remained dumb, much to the annoyance of the little
crowds, the members of which began to speculate
upon what had happened, and finally determined,
to their great satisfaction, that Webb himself had
committed the murder and that Mr. Proctor was
keeping an eye upon him till the police arrived to
arrest him. One of them even suggested to the
latter:</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better lock him up in Mrs. Yates’s
cellar, sir?”</p>

<p>“Lock who up?”</p>

<p>“Why, <em>him</em>,” pointing a condemnatory thumb over
his shoulder at the unconscious Webb.</p>

<p>“Lock yourself up for a silly fool,” retorted Mr.
Proctor contemptuously.</p>

<p>Presently a motor appeared dashing down the
road. It was driven by the superintendent of the
police. By his side was the doctor, and in the back
seat a burly constable and a man in plain clothes.
They all jumped out. Mr. Proctor, who was still
in supreme command, addressed a few words to
the superintendent.</p>

<p>“You’ve done quite right, sir—quite right,” said
the latter; “and now we’ll get on with things at
once.”</p>

<p>The superintendent was a quiet, refined-looking
man, with a big black moustache. The man in
plain clothes was of slight build, clean shaven, alert,
and with shrewd grey eyes.</p>

<p>“Now, sergeant,” said the superintendent, “you
and I will go aboard with the doctor.” He went on,
turning to the constable, “You stay here. We shall
want you, my man” he added, addressing Jim Webb.
“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Webb, sir.”</p>

<p>“Told you so,” said the man who had been
snubbed by Mr. Proctor. “They always confront
’em with their victims. Why don’t he put the
handcuffs on him?”</p>

<p>A boat was run down to the water, and Webb
pulled them out to the yacht.</p>

<p>The cabin was small. Webb, at the command of
the superintendent, stayed outside, while the three
men squeezed their way in. It was just the
ordinary saloon of a small yacht. There was a bunk
on either side, with lockers beneath and a
folding-table, fixed to the floor, ran half-way down the
centre. Huddled up to the floor, on his face, was the
body of Reginald Templeton.</p>

<p>The doctor went down on his knees by his side
and made a careful investigation.</p>

<p>“Stabbed in the back,” he said presently, “and
whoever did it knew the right place—right through
the heart, as far as I can see. He must have fallen
just as he is, and died instantaneously.”</p>

<p>“How long has he been dead?” asked the
superintendent.</p>

<p>The doctor went on with his examination, and
consulted his watch.</p>

<p>“Some hours,” he replied. “Rigor mortis has
begun to set in. I should say it might have been
after midnight—probably before. I should like to
make a complete examination later on. Can’t we
have him moved to the inn?”</p>

<p>“That will be best,” replied the superintendent.
“We’ll see about that.”</p>

<p>“There’s a motor just come,” said Webb from the
deck.</p>

<p>“That’s mine,” said the doctor. “I told my man
to follow us out. I’ll get back now, but I’ll be
down again later in the morning. There’s no more
I can do at present.”</p>

<p>“All right. Colson,” went on the superintendent
to the detective, “you’d like to stay aboard and
investigate a bit?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I want a good look round. And I
prefer working alone.”</p>

<p>The superintendent took a last searching glance
round the cabin.</p>

<p>“Webb!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>Webb put his head in at the doorway.</p>

<p>“That lamp,” and he pointed to an oil-lamp swinging
from the ceiling. “It’s burning. Did you light
it when you came aboard?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I never noticed it.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now pull me ashore, please.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Proctor,” he said when he came ashore and
the doctor had departed, “may we go into your
house? I want to ask Webb some questions.”</p>

<p>“By all means, Superintendent. Come along in.
Have you had breakfast yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks.”</p>

<p>“How about you, Webb?”</p>

<p>“I had some at Frattenbury, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll leave you,” said Mr. Proctor as he
took them into his dining-room.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that,” said the superintendent. “You
may be able to help us. Now then, Webb,” and he
took out his notebook.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your home?”</p>

<p>“Thirty-one, Fore Street, Salcombe, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’re a sailor?”</p>

<p>“I work for Mr. Jefferies, sir. He lets out boats.
He hired the <i>Firefly</i> to Mr. Templeton—Mr.
Reginald Templeton, sir.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Three weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been with him ever since?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” and he recapitulated what he had told
Tom Gale in the inn parlour.</p>

<p>“Who was Mr. Templeton?”</p>

<p>“He’d just come from Africa, sir. I reckon, from
what he said, he’d been exploring or something.
But he didn’t talk much. He knew how to handle
a boat, sir.”</p>

<p>“I see. And you visited all these places?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you know if he had any particular reason
for coming here?”</p>

<p>“I think he had, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“He asked from the first whether I knew the
coast. I said I did. I’ve an uncle in Frattenbury,
sir. And I’ve sailed in these parts several times.
He seemed pleased when I told him this.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>Webb thought a moment.</p>

<p>“He mentioned he’d be here some days, sir. Said
he had business. Said he was expected.”</p>

<p>“Who by?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say, sir. Only——”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“When we was in Weymouth he gave me a letter
to post—and, well——”</p>

<p>“You read the address?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well. What was it?”</p>

<p>“To a parson in Frattenbury, sir. A reverend
gentleman, name of Fittlemore—or something like
that.”</p>

<p>“Fittleworth?” asked the superintendent sharply.</p>

<p>“That’s it, sir; Fittleworth was the name.”</p>

<p>“Canon Fittleworth,” said the other. “Well,
that’s a help, anyhow. Now tell me about last
night.”</p>

<p>Webb told him how he had had leave to stay
in Frattenbury, and that Templeton had mentioned
he was going to dine there. A few more questions,
and the superintendent glanced over his notes.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “there’ll be an inquest, of course,
and we shall want you, Webb. What are you
thinking of doing?”</p>

<p>Webb hesitated.</p>

<p>“I don’t much fancy sleeping alone on the <i>Firefly</i>,
sir. I could get a bed at the inn here, or my
uncle at Frattenbury will put me up.”</p>

<p>“All right, so long as you keep in touch with us.
That’s all for the present. Thank you very much,
Mr. Proctor. You can go, Webb.”</p>

<p>Mr. Proctor rose from his chair, crossed the room
and showed Webb out of the door. Then he took
down a box from the shelf.</p>

<p>“Can I offer you a cigar, Superintendent?”</p>

<p>“Thanks very much.” The policeman lighted his
cigar, looked over his notes for a few minutes, and
then said: “You’re a good judge of cigars, Mr.
Proctor.”</p>

<p>“I am,” replied the little man with a smile. “This
is a strange case.”</p>

<p>“Um,” said the superintendent. “It’s too early
to form an opinion yet. But one thing is fairly
obvious. Whoever murdered Mr. Templeton must
have known he was coming here and must have
got out to that yacht after he returned from
Frattenbury and was aboard her.”</p>

<p>Mr. Proctor flicked the ash from the cigar he was
smoking, and observed dryly:</p>

<p>“Or have got aboard first, and waited for him
there.”</p>

<p>“What makes you say that?” asked the
superintendent, looking up quickly.</p>

<p>“Only because it’s just as obvious as your own
theory. I thought it might be worth considering.”</p>

<p>The superintendent reflected for a minute.</p>

<p>“Yes—it is,” he admitted. “Now I must be going.
I shall be back shortly.”</p>

<p>Before he finally left for Frattenbury he pulled
out to the <i>Firefly</i> and had a few words with the
detective-sergeant.</p>

<p>“When you’ve finished here,” he said, “you’d
better make a few inquiries on shore. Find out
who owns the boats about here. One of them must
have been used by the murderer, otherwise the
dinghy wouldn’t have been here. Get to work
among the people, and make a note of them, or of
any strangers. I’m off to see the coroner. Also
I’ve discovered that Templeton was probably dining
with Canon Fittleworth last night. At any rate,
he knew him. I’ll bring the Canon back with me
if he’s able to come.”</p>

<p>“Right, sir. I’ll do what I can.”</p>

<p>After a last injunction to the constable on the
shore, the superintendent entered his motor and
drove off.</p>

<p>“He ain’t took that ’ere man back with him,
after all,” said the disappointed spectator who had
fixed the crime onto the unfortunate Jim Webb.
“And that’s what we pays our police for!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV. <br> What Canon Fittleworth Found on the “Firefly”</h2>

<p>Canon Fittleworth had only just returned to
his house in the Close from the early Sunday service
in the Cathedral, and had sat down to his breakfast
with his wife and daughter. He was a cheerful-looking
ecclesiastic, apparently midway between
forty and fifty, wearing pince-nez over a pair of
keen brown eyes.</p>

<p>He had just answered a question put by his
daughter, and was beginning to attack his egg, when
a servant came in.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir, Superintendent Norton wishes
to speak to you. He says it’s very particular. I’ve
shown him into the study, sir.”</p>

<p>“The police!” exclaimed Doris Fittleworth.
“What have you been doing, father?”</p>

<p>“I’ve quite a clear conscience, dear. Tell him
to wait ten minutes,” he added to the servant.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, he said he must see you at once,” she
replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said the Canon, not pleased to
be interrupted at his meal. “Keep my toast warm,”
he added to his wife as he went out of the room.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Superintendent. You wanted to
see me!”</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir. I’m sorry to disturb you,
but it’s urgent.”</p>

<p>“Anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so. Will you tell me, please—do you
know a Mr. Reginald Templeton, and have you
seen him lately?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I do. He’s my cousin. He was
only dining with me last evening. I hadn’t seen
him for a long time. What is it?”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry to tell you, Canon, that Mr.
Templeton was discovered on his yacht at Marsh
Quay this morning, dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead? Why, he was in the best of health last
night!”</p>

<p>“Murdered,” went on the inspector gravely.</p>

<p>The Canon started, and seized both arms of the
chair in which he was seated.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” he exclaimed. “This is
terrible, Superintendent. Reginald <em>murdered</em>, you
say?”</p>

<p>Briefly the superintendent gave him the details,
explaining how he had ascertained that the Canon
knew the murdered man.</p>

<p>“Exactly. He wrote to me from Weymouth, and
again from Ryde. I was expecting him last night.
I hadn’t seen him for six or seven years—he’d been
abroad. I wanted him to stay the night, but he
wouldn’t. He was always keen on boating, and was
enjoying the life, he told me. Would to heaven he
<em>had</em> stayed!”</p>

<p>“What time did he leave you?”</p>

<p>“He got here between five and six. We dined
early—at seven. He left about half-past eight.”</p>

<p>“Going straight back to Marsh Quay, I suppose?”</p>

<p>The superintendent had taken out his notebook.</p>

<p>“No, he said he had a call to pay first in
Frattenbury.”</p>

<p>“On whom?” asked the other, keenly interested.</p>

<p>“He didn’t say. He was a very reticent man—always.
I wondered at the time, because I didn’t
remember that he knew anyone here besides
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps, Canon, you would like to
see him—in fact, I should wish you to, if you can.
I have to see the coroner, then—in about a quarter
of an hour—I can come back and run you down in
my car.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” replied the Canon. “I’ll come
if you think I can be of any use.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Canon, I’m sure it will help us.”</p>

<p>He went out, and the Canon returned to break
the terrible news to his family.</p>

<p>The superintendent drove a little way through
the ancient city to a quiet, Georgian street, and
stopped before a solid, square-looking house, which
bore a brass plate on the door with the inscription,
“Mr. F. Norwood, Solicitor.” A minute later he
was in the presence of Mr. Norwood, who rose from
his chair to greet him.</p>

<p>Mr. Francis Norwood was one of the best-known
professional men in Frattenbury and its neighbourhood.
He had a large and select practice, an
old-established one inherited from his father. He was
an austere-looking man, with a hatchet-shaped face,
large nose, thin, tightly-compressed lips, and
old-fashioned mutton-chop whiskers. His hair, which
was inclined to be grey, was thin and carefully
parted in the middle. He wore dark trousers, a
black cutaway coat, and black tie with a small
gold pin.</p>

<p>He looked the very epitome of a dry, respectable
lawyer, and eminently suitable for the environment
of a cathedral city. He had never married—people
said unkind things about him in this respect—that
no woman would accept such a dry stick of
a man—that he was too fond of himself and too
close with his money to risk a partner.</p>

<p>For many years he had held the office of coroner—as
his father had done before him. Many people
called him selfish in still holding it. There were
younger and struggling men who would have been
glad of the occasional fees, whereas Francis
Norwood was reputed wealthy. But this criticism—even
if he knew it—had no effect upon the staid lawyer.
He stuck to his post and he stuck to the fees which
it brought him.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Superintendent; won’t you sit
down?” said the lawyer, motioning the other to a
chair, and reseating himself. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“A case of murder, I’m afraid, Mr. Norwood.”</p>

<p>“Murder? Dear, dear! That’s very serious.
Tell me about it.”</p>

<p>As the superintendent told his story, the coroner
sat bolt upright, listening intently, his elbows on
the arms of his chair, the tips of his fingers pressed
together.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, as the other finished, “a bad case—a
very bad case. I’ll open the inquiry to-morrow.
We shall have to adjourn it, of course. Let me
see”—and he consulted a pocket diary. “Two o’clock
to-morrow. Will that do?”</p>

<p>“Quite well, Mr. Norwood. It will give us time
to get the preliminary facts in order.”</p>

<p>“Just so. As far as my recollection serves me,
there is a public-house close to the quay?”</p>

<p>“The ‘Mariner’s Arms,’ ”</p>

<p>“Ah, just so. The inquest will take place there.
You will summon a jury?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>The coroner folded his hands again. He was an
extremely stiff individual.</p>

<p>“This will mean a lot of work for you,” he said.
“Have you any clue so far?”</p>

<p>“There’s been no time yet, Mr. Norwood. I left
the very best man we’ve got at Marsh
Quay—Detective-Sergeant Colson, an extremely smart fellow.”</p>

<p>“I see. Exactly. Do you intend to call in the
services of Scotland Yard?”</p>

<p>The superintendent smiled.</p>

<p>“That depends on what the Chief Constable says,
Mr. Norwood—when I’ve made my report to him.
But we like, if we can, to get the credit of a case
like this ourselves. And I’ve great confidence in
Colson. However, developments will probably
answer your question.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. It’s no affair of mine of course.
But I hope you’ll take every step to find the
murderer.”</p>

<p>“You can trust us for that,” replied the other as
he rose to go. “Two o’clock to-morrow, then?”</p>

<p>“Two o’clock to-morrow, Superintendent,” repeated
the coroner. “I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>He accompanied the policeman out of the room
and through a big square, stone-paved hall to the
front door, shaking hands with him stiffly and limply
as he left.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the superintendent was
driving Canon Fittleworth to Marsh Quay. As they
reached the spot, he pointed out the <i>Firefly</i>.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said the Canon, “we were to have
come over for a sail in her to-morrow. How
terribly sad!”</p>

<p>When they arrived on the yacht they found Colson
sitting on deck, smoking. He hardly looked
at them. The superintendent, who knew his man,
took the Canon into the little saloon. The body
had been laid on the table ready for removal; a
handkerchief was over the face.</p>

<p>Canon Fittleworth lifted it reverently.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” he exclaimed; “it’s Reginald
Templeton, of course—poor fellow!”</p>

<p>He was almost breaking down. The superintendent,
a sympathetic and sensitive man himself, said:</p>

<p>“I’m going to speak to Colson, sir.”</p>

<p>The other nodded. When he was alone he
kneeled down, bowed his head, and prayed silently
for a few minutes. Then, without rising, he looked
about him mechanically.</p>

<p>At times of great stress the smallest objects are
often noticeable. An instance of this strange truth
occurred just then. The Canon’s gaze fell on something
lying on the floor of the cabin—partly bright
red and partly shining. With a sort of muffled
curiosity, he stooped and picked it up. It was a
cigar band.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing particularly striking in a
cigar band. It is a common enough object. True,
cigar bands vary in their queer little heraldic
designs and miniature shields, and inscriptions of the
firms that produced them, in Spanish. But, as the
Canon looked at that torn object, he suddenly
started.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” he murmured, smoothing it out
and regarding it intently. He took off his glasses,
wiped them with his handkerchief, and had another
look. His brow puckered. Again he said:</p>

<p>“Queer—very queer.”</p>

<p>Now the Canon was entirely ignorant of police
methods—they had never come within his sphere.
Also, by virtue of his office and dignity, he was
accustomed to act on his own initiative. Besides,
that particular cigar band had led his thoughts far
away from that scene of death—it was something
personal that was arresting his attention. Also,
he had been, all his life, one of those men who are
reticent up to a point, that point being the exact
moment when they are ready to lay all their cards
on the table. He wanted to compare this particular
bit of red and gold with something else before he
could be quite certain of the matter that was
agitating his mind.</p>

<p>These several reasons combined to prevent him
doing what many a man would have done under
similar circumstances—calling in the superintendent.
It never entered his head at that moment that he
ought to do any such thing. Instead, he took out a
his pocket-case and carefully deposited the cigar
band within it.</p>

<p>Then he rose from his knees and looked round
the cabin, gazed again at the cold, white face on the
table, spread the handkerchief over it, and slowly
left the saloon—a great weight on his mind as the
thought of his murdered cousin pressed itself
uppermost. In silence he rejoined the two policemen
on the deck, took his seat in the boat, and came
ashore with them. For the time being the incident
of the cigar band had passed out of his mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Proctor greeted them.</p>

<p>“Canon Fittleworth, I presume?” he asked
politely. “My name is Proctor. May I be allowed
to express my sympathy, sir? I understand the
unfortunate gentleman is a relative of yours.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>

<p>“And may I venture to ask you both to come in
and have a glass of sherry and a biscuit? I’m sure
you both need something after such a strain. It
will give me much pleasure if you will.”</p>

<p>“It’s very good of you,” said the Canon. “And
I won’t refuse.”</p>

<p>The little man took them into a cosy dining-room
which overlooked the estuary. On the table was a
plate of sandwiches, biscuits, a decanter of wine
and glasses. He helped them to refreshments and
then said:</p>

<p>“If you’ll excuse me—pray make yourselves at
home.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the superintendent as Mr.
Proctor left the room. He did not press him to
stay, as he wanted a few minutes’ conversation with
Canon Fittleworth.</p>

<p>“We shall have to ask you to give formal evidence
of identification at the inquest to-morrow,
Canon. And, of course, you will tell the jury what
you know of Mr. Templeton—and his movements
last evening.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Though, as a matter of fact, I know
very little of him. As I told you, he has been
abroad for some years. He’s a bachelor—and was
always a rolling stone. He told us something of his
travels last night—not very much.”</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded. “There are one or
two questions I want to ask, please.”</p>

<p>“By all means.”</p>

<p>“Tell me—do you think Mr. Templeton had any
object in coming to Marsh Quay other than paying
you a visit?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Canon, “I feel sure he had.
He spoke vaguely of having business in the
neighbourhood—but I haven’t the slightest idea what it
was—except, yes—now I come to think of it he did
drop a hint.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked the superintendent, leaning
forward.</p>

<p>“He said that ever since he landed in Plymouth
he’d been carrying about something valuable that
made him a bit anxious—that he was glad to be
getting rid of.”</p>

<p>“Did he say what it was?”</p>

<p>“No. He only mentioned it casually.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” mused the other, “there may be something
in this. It may mean the motive for the
crime—robbery.”</p>

<p>“That is quite possible. I wish he’d told us more.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. One other question. You say he was
going to see someone in Frattenbury last
evening——”</p>

<p>“Yes—but I haven’t the slightest idea who it
was.”</p>

<p>“I know—but I was going to ask, did he give
you a hint of anyone else he knew in this
neighbourhood?”</p>

<p>The Canon thought carefully before he replied:</p>

<p>“Only that, as I said, he referred to some business
that he had in hand here.”</p>

<p>The superintendent was silent. He drank his
glass of wine and looked out of the window. Colson
was coming up the garden path. In a few seconds
he entered the room.</p>

<p>“There’s something I must tell you at once, sir.”
And he looked at the Canon.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said the superintendent. “We are
speaking in confidence,” he added.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the Canon.</p>

<p>“I’ve just been talking to a man named Gale
who was here all day yesterday. He saw the <i>Firefly</i>
come in and anchor, and what’s more he saw Templeton
row himself across to the other side—yonder,”
and he pointed out of the window, “and reappear
after about three-quarters of an hour with a Jew
named Moss, who lives in that house you can see
above the trees. He recognised him distinctly, even
at that distance. Then Templeton pulled himself
back to the yacht—and afterwards came ashore
here.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the superintendent, springing
to his feet. “We’ll interview this man Moss at
once.”</p>

<p>“I should like to come too, if I may,” said Canon
Fittleworth.</p>

<p>“There’s no reason why you shouldn’t. Ah—Webb
is about still. We’ll get him to row us across.
Come along, Colson.”</p>

<p>Arrived on the other side of the estuary, they
made their way through the woody path and in a
few minutes came out on an open space where the
house was standing. It was a modern two-storied
villa, with a small garden and a garage.</p>

<p>The superintendent rang the front door bell. The
door was opened by a woman of about five and
thirty. Her face paled a little as she saw the police
uniform.</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Moss live here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—when he’s down here for week-ends.”</p>

<p>“Is he in?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where we can find him?”</p>

<p>“He’s gone back to London, sir, with Mrs. Moss.”</p>

<p>“Gone back to London, when?”</p>

<p>“This morning, sir—by the early train from
Frattenbury. My husband motored them both into
Frattenbury.”</p>

<p>“Do you live here with your husband?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We’re caretakers all the week. I do
the cooking, and Mrs. Moss brings down a maid
when they come for week-ends.”</p>

<p>“Is your husband in?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—I hope there’s nothing the matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing for you to disturb yourself about. Will
you call your husband, please, and come back
yourself.”</p>

<p>The man who appeared was a little defiant, but
the superintendent cautioned him sharply, and he
answered the questions he put—though rather
sullenly.</p>

<p>“You drove your master and mistress into
Frattenbury this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I did.”</p>

<p>“At what time?”</p>

<p>“To catch the 7.35 up train.”</p>

<p>“When did you get the order—last night?”</p>

<p>“No—this morning.”</p>

<p>“It must have been very early?”</p>

<p>“Soon after six o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Do they often go up by this Sunday morning
train?”</p>

<p>“No, sir—I never knew them do it before. It’s
generally on Mondays they leave—or, leastways,
Mr. Moss always does.”</p>

<p>“Do either of you know where he lives in
London?”</p>

<p>“Not his private house, sir—we forward any
letters that come—or write to him at his business
address.”</p>

<p>“And what’s that?”</p>

<p>“13a, Hatton Garden, sir.”</p>

<p>The superintendent and Colson exchanged
significant glances.</p>

<p>“That seems to point out what his trade is,” said
the latter.</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded, then he went on with
his questions.</p>

<p>“Did your master receive any visitor yesterday
afternoon? Now, be careful, please.”</p>

<p>The woman shot a glance at her husband—who
only stared stonily back, with his hands in his
pockets.</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t let anyone in, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you didn’t. But you saw someone?—you
must tell me, please.”</p>

<p>“I—I happened to be looking out of the window,
sir—and Mr. Moss was sitting on a chair on the
lawn—with another gentleman.”</p>

<p>“What was he like?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say, sir. I didn’t notice him
particularly. And he had his back to me.”</p>

<p>“Very well. What time was this?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere between four and five, sir.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Moss must have brought him indoors, sir.
I heard them talking in his study, as I came by,
but I never saw him.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything they said?”</p>

<p>“No, sir—I should scorn to listen.”</p>

<p>The superintendent thought for a moment, then
he said:</p>

<p>“Thank you—that’s all.”</p>

<p>The man stepped forward.</p>

<p>“I should like to know if there’s any trouble
about, sir. We’re decent folk, my wife and I, and
we don’t want to be mixed up in no rows—especially
if the police are in it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, my man—don’t worry. We only
wanted to see your master about this visitor of his.
Another time will do very well. Good day.”</p>

<p>As they walked back to the boat, the Canon
remarked:</p>

<p>“We don’t seem to have got very much
information here.”</p>

<p>“No, but it’s important,” replied the superintendent,
“and we’ve got to find out why this Mr. Moss
left in such a hurry. We’ll very soon get onto
his track.”</p>

<p>Colson nodded thoughtfully, but said nothing. He
was a silent man when at his work—except when
he was drawing out information. Then he could be
companionable enough. But he rarely made remarks
as to probable or possible results while he
was actually investigating a case.</p>

<p>When they came back to Marsh Quay, Colson
was left in charge, and the constable instructed to
warn men for the jury. The body had been carried
over to the “Mariner’s Arms” and laid on a bed in
one of Mrs. Yates’s rooms. The superintendent
drove Canon Fittleworth back to Frattenbury, and
then went on to report to Major Renshaw, the Chief
Constable, who lived just outside the city.</p>

<p>That evening, Canon Fittleworth sat in his comfortable
study, discussing the events of the day with
his wife and daughter. He put his hand in his pocket
for something, and felt his case there. Then he
remembered.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he said, “that reminds me.”</p>

<p>“What, dear?” asked his wife.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>He got up, unlocked a cabinet, and took out a
box of cigars. Then he produced the red and gold
band from his pocket, and carefully compared it
with those on the cigars in the box.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, as he went back to his seat;
“I found this lying on the floor in the cabin where
poor Reginald was murdered.”</p>

<p>“Poor man,” said his daughter, as she took the
cigar band to look at it; “do you think that he was
smoking when he was murdered?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Canon; “Reginald did not smoke.
I offered him a cigar last night and he refused it.
He said he hadn’t smoked for years, and he disliked
it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, daddy,” exclaimed the girl, “you ought to
have shown this to the police!”</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought—yes—I never thought of it.
However, I shall bring it forward at the inquest
to-morrow. But there’s something very queer about
it,” he went on.</p>

<p>“What is it, Charles?” asked his wife.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s off one of my own cigars!”</p>

<p>“Off one of your own cigars?” exclaimed his
daughter.</p>

<p>“Look for yourself,” and he passed the box over
to them.</p>

<p>“But,” said the girl, when they had both compared
the band with the others, “anyone might smoke the
same sort of cigar.”</p>

<p>“No, they mightn’t. That’s just the point,”
replied the Canon dryly. “This box was sent to me
by my Spanish friend, De Garcia—you remember
him? Well, he wrote to say they are a special brand
reserved for the planters. They never sell them
anywhere. What do you think of <em>that</em>?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V. <br> Detective-Sergeant Colson Discovers Clues</h2>

<p>“Mrs. Yates,” said Detective-Sergeant Colson, as
he finished a modest meal, served at his request
in the “Mariner’s Arms,” “I am thinking of making
my quarters here, at all events till the inquest is
over. Can I have a room?”</p>

<p>“I’m only too glad to have you, sir,” replied the
buxom landlady. “I’m not much given to be afraid,
but I don’t like the idea of being alone in the house
with a corpse, and I was thinking of asking a
neighbour to sleep here.”</p>

<p>“You’re a widow, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—these six years.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be here to-night. I’m going into
Frattenbury presently, and shall cycle out, probably a
bit late.”</p>

<p>“You can have the room Mr. Grayson had, sir.
It’s a pleasant one, above this, looking out over the
water.”</p>

<p>“Who is Mr. Grayson?” he asked.</p>

<p>“A young gentleman—an artist—who’s been
lodging here nearly a week. He left early this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did he?” said the detective, lighting his pipe.
“This seems a rare place for people leaving early
on Sunday mornings.”</p>

<p>“Eh, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind. Tell me about this lodger of
yours. What time did he go away?”</p>

<p>“It was just before the murder was discovered,
sir. He came downstairs early this morning, and
said would I get him some breakfast because he’d
suddenly changed his plans and was going away.
Seemed strange, didn’t it, sir? A nice, quiet young
gentleman he was, too.”</p>

<p>“How did he go?”</p>

<p>“On his bicycle, sir—same as he came here. Oh,
he was a perfect gentleman, never gave me trouble,
and paid up all right.”</p>

<p>The detective had taken out his notebook.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d give me a description of this young
man, Mrs. Yates,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Colson, sir,” she exclaimed, “you don’t
mean to say as how you think ’twas him as done it?”</p>

<p>The detective laughed.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Mrs. Yates,” he said; “I never said
it was so bad as that. But, you see, we policemen
like to know about all the people that were near
a crime. That’s why I’m asking you to help me.
The smallest evidence may be valuable, and this
young man may have noticed something yesterday.
You see, he left before the murder was discovered,
so he couldn’t know we wanted him, could he?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates, all suspicions removed by Colson’s
bland manner, gave him, so far as she could
remember, a description of her lodger, which the
detective carefully took down. When she had finished,
he said:</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Yates; excellent! You really
ought to belong to the force, you remember everything
so well. Observation is a very great gift, and
you’ve got it. Splendid!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates smiled a smile of satisfaction. She
was not proof against flattery. The detective saw
he had scored a point.</p>

<p>“Now I’m going to take you into my confidence,”
he went on blandly. “I’ll let you into a little secret.
We detectives aren’t half as clever as people think
we are, and I don’t mind telling you—quite between
ourselves, you know—that this is going to be a
difficult case. You wouldn’t think it, perhaps, but, up
to the present moment, I haven’t the slightest idea
as to who committed the murder.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates had sat down in a chair and was
regarding him fixedly, taking it all in.</p>

<p>“Lor’ sir,” she exclaimed, “you don’t say so?”</p>

<p>He nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“It’s quite true,” he said, “and I want you to help
me.”</p>

<p>“Me, sir? What can I do?”</p>

<p>“You’re a discreet woman, Mrs. Yates—a very
sensible woman. And I’m sure you can hold your
tongue if you like.”</p>

<p>“I never was one to gossip.”</p>

<p>“I knew it! Well, now, when I come back this
evening I don’t want anyone to know I’m here. You
put some supper up in my room—show me now
how I can get up to it without being seen—and
if anyone asks where I am, you can tell them the
truth, that I’m gone into Frattenbury, see?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates, who was almost trembling with
excitement, showed him how he could get in by a
back door she would leave unlatched. She also
showed him a shed where he could put his bicycle.</p>

<p>“And one other thing, Mrs. Yates,” he said;
“you’re going to keep your mouth shut, but you
must keep your ears open. You’re sure to have men
in to-night discussing the murder. If you hear them
say anything about having seen Mr. Templeton—or
any strangers about—you make a note of it and
let me know.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir. I’ll do what I can.”</p>

<p>Colson took his hat and stick and a dispatch-case
which he had brought over in the morning.</p>

<p>When he got outside the inn he walked over to
Constable Gadsden, who was still on the spot. Quite
a number of people were about, for the news had
spread rapidly, and anything so gruesome as the
central scene of a murder is attractive.</p>

<p>“Well, Gadsden,” said he, drawing him to one
side, “you haven’t let anyone go on board the
yacht—no newspaper men, or anyone?”</p>

<p>The burly policeman grinned.</p>

<p>“Trust me for that, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“Mind you don’t. I’m going into Frattenbury
now. I’ll send a man out to relieve you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sergeant. I’ve found out something
since I saw you.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>The policeman opened his pocket-book. No self-respecting
constable ever reports to a superior officer
without a reference to this mysterious compendium.</p>

<p>“Man o’ the name o’ Simmonds—George Simmonds—lives
in the cottage yonder—states that he
was walking along the field path yesterday and met
a man of the description o’ Mr. Templeton going
into Frattenbury—between half-past five and six.”</p>

<p>“May be useful,” replied the detective. “More
useful still, though, if he’d seen him coming back.
If there’s anything else to report you can do so to
the superintendent when you get back to
Frattenbury.”</p>

<p>He himself took the field path to Frattenbury, and
not the road. For half a mile or so the path ran
by the side of the estuary, separated from the shore
by a low hedge. Then, just as one got over a stile,
it turned abruptly and led through a series of marshy
meadows. There had been rain a few days before,
and in places the path was damp, showing a number
of footprints.</p>

<p>Just by one of the stiles was a particularly
impressionable bit of ground. The stile had a high
step, from which one naturally jumped and left
well-defined footprints. Colson seated himself on the
stile, opened his dispatch-case, and drew out a shoe.
Then he got down into the path and investigated
all the footprints narrowly, testing them by measuring
them and comparing the results with the shoe.</p>

<p>Presently he gave a little grunt of satisfaction.
The shoe exactly fitted one of the footprints.
Walking slowly on, he was easily able to trace these
particular footprints going towards Frattenbury.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t help much,” he said to himself, “but—ah,
here’s what I want.”</p>

<p>For he caught sight of a similar footprint—and
then another—pointing in the reverse direction.
Several more were apparent as he walked on.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” he exclaimed; “Templeton
walked back to Marsh Quay by the same route.
I’m glad I thought to bring one of the shoes he was
wearing with me. Now for the other test.”</p>

<p>The other test was still more simple. Every now
and then, plainly defined, was a small square hole
showing in the soft soil, about three-eighths of an
inch in diameter. The detective stuck the walking-stick
he was carrying into the ground beside one of
these holes. It bore one of those tapering, square
ferrules which are common in Alpine walking-sticks.
When he removed it from the soil, the impression
was exactly the same as the other.</p>

<p>A less shrewd man than Colson would have been
perfectly satisfied with the result, and would have
made the very natural deduction that Templeton
had carried the walking-stick. Indeed, there was
every reason to deduce this. But Colson was not
only a quick-witted man—he was also a slow and
careful thinker. It was his method, when he had
discovered any clue, to work out every possible
explanation from it mentally raising objections to each
deduction. More than once this habit of his had
prevented him acting on hasty and erroneous
conclusions, and he knew the value of it well.</p>

<p>Besides, this was the biggest case in which he had
been engaged. Never yet had he been called upon
to investigate so serious a crime as murder, except
in one instance, where everything had been fairly
obvious from the first. So, for his own credit and
chances of promotion, he was anxious to make no
mistake.</p>

<p>Therefore, having turned the matter over in his
mind, when he reached Frattenbury, instead of going
straight to the police station to make his report,
he called on Canon Fittleworth. This was in the
afternoon, and, it will be remembered, before the
Canon had compared the cigar band with those in
his box.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to disturb you,” he said, “but you may
be able to tell me something. When Mr. Templeton
left your house last night, who showed him out?”</p>

<p>“I did,” replied the Canon.</p>

<p>“Good. Now can you remember if he was
carrying a walking-stick when he left?”</p>

<p>They were standing in the hall as they were
talking.</p>

<p>“I can tell you exactly,” said the Canon. “He
had a stick when he came here—this is it,” and he
drew one from the rack, “but when we opened the
door last night it was clouding up and looked like
rain, and the glass was falling. Templeton said he
didn’t want to risk getting wet, as he suffered from
rheumatism. I lent him an umbrella. By the way,
I saw it in the cabin of the yacht, now I come to
think of it.”</p>

<p>Colson had taken the stick into his hand and
was examining the point of it. He lifted his
eyebrows and gave a low whistle. The ferrule was of
the Alpine pattern. He carefully compared it with
the one he had brought from Marsh Quay. The
sizes were exactly the same.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Canon Fittleworth.</p>

<p>“Only a curious coincidence, that throws me
entirely out of my reckoning. I’ll take this stick,
please. Oh, by the way, I went through all the
papers I could find on the <i>Firefly</i>. There was
nothing particular. Only, perhaps you can throw some
light on this one.”</p>

<p>He took a letter from his pocket and handed it
to the Canon. It bore an address in North-West
London, and the writer merely said he was glad to
hear that Templeton had arrived in England, and
hoped that, when he was tired of yachting, he would
run up to see him, as there were two or three matters
of business to discuss. It was signed “A. F. Crosby.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who it is?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said the Canon. “I ought to have
thought of it before, but this terrible event has put
things out of my mind. Templeton mentioned his
name last night. He said he was going up to town
shortly to see his lawyer, Anthony Crosby. I know
him slightly myself. I ought to have written to him.
I’ll do so at once.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s capital,” said Colson. “Don’t you
trouble to write. We’ll ’phone up to the London
police, and ask them to see him at once. We must
have him down to the inquest to-morrow, if possible.
He may be a great help. Thank you very much.
I must be off.”</p>

<p>When he arrived at the police station he found
the superintendent in consultation with the Chief
Constable, Major Renshaw, a typical military man
with close-cropped moustache.</p>

<p>The two men welcomed the detective-sergeant
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the superintendent, “we’re very
anxious to know developments. Have you had any
luck?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—several things have come to light, and
there may be something to go upon, though I’m
still very much in the dark. First of all, though,
I’ll get you to have this description ’phoned to the
police throughout the county—a young man, a
cyclist, staying at the ‘Mariner’s Arms,’ who left
suddenly early this morning. The landlady says he
was apparently riding into Frattenbury. We ought
to get hold of him in any case.”</p>

<p>“Most decidedly,” said the Chief Constable. “It’s
important.”</p>

<p>After this was done, and the matter of Mr. Crosby
taken in hand, the superintendent told Colson that
he had telephoned to London about Moss, but, as
yet, there were no developments. Then the detective
opened his dispatch-case and spread an assortment
of articles on the table.</p>

<p>“I made a pretty searching examination,” he said,
“but I’m afraid there are not many results so far.
The lockers and portmanteau mostly contained
clothes—and some money. There’s only one letter—and
there weren’t many—that seemed to bear on
the case, and it isn’t signed. Here it is, in an
envelope with the Frattenbury postmark, posted to
the G.P.O., Ryde. And it’s typewritten.”</p>

<p>The letter proved to be a half-sheet of nondescript
notepaper, with the words:</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p>“I shall be at home to discuss matters if you will
  call next Saturday evening after 8.30—not later
  than 9.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That was all. A grim smile lit up the face of the
Chief Constable as he read it, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“That’s not much help,” he said. “Of course it’s
the appointment Canon Fittleworth spoke of. What
next?”</p>

<p>The detective produced a blotting-pad.</p>

<p>“There’s not much here,” he said, “but if you
hold it before a looking-glass you can make out
what I think to be bits of two letters.”</p>

<p>Across the top of the blotter, by holding it in
front of the glass portions of words appeared as
follows:</p>

<blockquote class="blotter">

  <p> e  y u on   turd    ft    on,</p>

</blockquote>

<p>and then the signature, freshly blotted and quite
plain:</p>

<blockquote class="blotter-signature">

  <p class="valediction">Y  rs f ithfully,</p>
  <p class="signature">R. Templeton.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“ ‘See you on Saturday afternoon,’ ” said the
superintendent. “That ought to be plain enough.
It looks like his appointment with Moss. We know
he went there.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said the detective. “Now try the
other. That’s a puzzler.”</p>

<p>For some time the two men scrutinised the
blotting-paper. The ink marks were faint and broken,
and in most cases only isolated letters, or bits of
words. Finally, they agreed with Colson that the
result was this:</p>

<blockquote class="blotter">

  <p> a d  ver  zr    ice s  o     ion &amp;  roo </p>
  <p>   s is   nal</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“Well,” said the Chief Constable, “you’ll be a
smart fellow if you make anything out of
<em>that</em>—even if it’s worth anything. What next?”</p>

<p>“I went through his pockets. There were no papers
of any kind in them. That looks suspicious. A
gentleman in his position would hardly go about
without a pocket-book or something. There was
loose cash in the trousers pockets—and in the
waistcoat pocket I found this.”</p>

<p>He produced a very small bag of chamois leather,
with a loose string tied to it to fasten it.</p>

<p>“Look!” he said, as he shook something out on
the table.</p>

<p>The two men started. A brilliant coruscation of
light flashed before them. It was a diamond the
size of a pea.</p>

<p>“Uncut,” said the Major, as he took it up to examine
it; “in the rough at present, but still
brilliant. It’s worth a heap of money. And he came
from South Africa? Where are the rest?”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the superintendent, “and where does
Moss come in?”</p>

<p>“There’s something else,” said Colson, “and I’m
not sure whether it may not be the best clue of
all—if we can find the owner of it.”</p>

<p>And he laid the two walking-sticks on the table.</p>

<p>“This one,” he went on, taking up the one the
Canon had given him, “was carried by Templeton
when he walked into Frattenbury yesterday afternoon.
I’ve traced the marks of it along the field
path. But he didn’t take it back with him—Canon
Fittleworth lent him an umbrella. And this one,”
he added, taking up the other, “I found under the
stern seat of the dinghy. I’d almost made up my
mind it had belonged to Templeton, but inquiry from
the Canon seems to show it didn’t. After I’d found
it I questioned Templeton’s man—Webb—though I
took care not to let him see it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>“Because, sir, I never like to give anything away
if I can possibly help it; and I thought, even then,
that it might possibly have belonged to someone
else. What I wanted to find out from Webb was
whether there had been more than one walking-stick
aboard the <i>Firefly</i>. And there hadn’t. So now we
know that this stick must have been left by someone
else who went out to the yacht.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said the superintendent. “And
somebody else knows it, too.”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Major Renshaw.</p>

<p>The superintendent and Colson exchanged
meaning glances, and answered simultaneously:</p>

<p>“The man who left it there.”</p>

<p>And Colson added:</p>

<p>“He made a bad mistake. And it’s mistakes that
are the best clues. That’s my experience.”</p>

<p>The Chief Constable and the superintendent examined
the stick carefully. It was a very ordinary
plain ash walking-stick, with a crook handle. The
only noticeable thing about it was that a small piece
had been chipped off the handle. Otherwise there
was nothing remarkable about it.</p>

<p>Colson sat lost in thought. Presently his face
cleared a little.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea,” he said; “it’s only a sort of
forlorn hope. But I may as well try it. By the way,
I promised Gadsden he should be relieved, sir,”
he added to the superintendent. “He’s been at Marsh
Quay since early morning.”</p>

<p>The superintendent touched a bell, and a
constable entered.</p>

<p>“Is Peters in?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Tell him to report for duty.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p>Peters came in, and the superintendent gave him
some brief instructions. Then Colson spoke.</p>

<p>“I want you to do exactly what I say, Peters,”
he said. “When you get to Marsh Quay it will still
be daylight. Ride your bicycle there and leave it
close to the shore. Then take one of the little canoes
and paddle out to the yacht—the <i>Firefly</i>. Don’t in
any way touch the dinghy that’s moored to her.
Get on the yacht’s deck and stay there. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“As soon as it’s struck ten—or thereabouts—keep
your eye fixed on the upper window in the ‘Mariner’s
Arms.’ There may be a light in the room. Don’t
take any notice of that. But directly you see the
flash of a red light in the window, get into the canoe
and paddle ashore. Make a bit of noise about it.
Leave the canoe in the water—the tide will be
flowing—and make the painter fast to one of the posts
you will find—well up the little bank. Then light
your bicycle lamp and ride off—back to Frattenbury.
I shan’t want you any more. If there’s anybody
about, sing out ‘Good night’ to them—let ’em
see you’re going off. You understand?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“That’s all, then. Good night, Major, if I don’t
see you again. I’ll drop in,” he added to the
superintendent, “before I go back to Marsh Quay. I’ve
got a little job first. And I want this walking-stick.”</p>

<p>He went out, carrying the stick he had found in
the dinghy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI. <br> Colson is Baffled</h2>

<p>Colson walked away from the police station till
he came to a shop. It was Sunday and, of course, the
shutters were up, but he rang the bell at the side
door. It was opened by the proprietor, a thin,
sandy-haired man, who shook hands with the detective.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Colson,” he said, “come in,
won’t you? We were just sitting down to tea. The
wife will be pleased, I’m sure, if you’ll join us.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mr. Blake. I’m sorry to disturb
you. But I want you to do something for
me—if you will?”</p>

<p>Blake looked at him with interest.</p>

<p>“Anything about this murder at Marsh Quay?”
he asked. “I heard you were down there.”</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Mr. Blake, you and I know one
another pretty well. Don’t you ask me any questions
about that, please. I believe you’re a discreet man,
or I shouldn’t have come to you. Will you hold your
tongue about it? About what I’m going to ask you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will, Mr. Colson.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I want you to sell me a walking-stick—on
a Sunday. Can we go into your shop?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Come along.”</p>

<p>He led the way into the shop, and turned on the
electric light. Whereat it was obvious that Mr.
Blake dealt in tobacco, and those other articles which
generally characterise a tobacconist’s trade.</p>

<p>“What sort of a stick do you want?”</p>

<p>“One exactly like this—if you’ve got one.”</p>

<p>Blake took the stick in his hand and examined it
carefully.</p>

<p>“You don’t know that stick, I suppose? You
haven’t seen it before?” asked Colson.</p>

<p>“Can’t say I have. It’s ordinary enough, eh?
With a Swiss ferrule, too. Might have been bought
in Switzerland, and might not. We keep a few of
these ferrules now—some of our customers prefer
them. Let’s see—it ought to be easy to find one
like it.”</p>

<p>A bundle of sticks was laid on the counter.
Presently one was found very closely resembling that
brought by Colson.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, “this will do—if you can put
another ferrule on it.”</p>

<p>“That’s easily done. Let’s be sure it’s the exact
length—ah—we must take half an inch off it. If
you’re going to palm it off on anyone as the original,
it’s a hint to remember that nothing would give it
away so much as a difference, however small, in
length. Half a minute. My tools are at the back
of the shop.”</p>

<p>When he returned with the two sticks he said:</p>

<p>“You’ve noticed yours is chipped a bit in the
handle?”</p>

<p>“I know. I’ll make the other all right.”</p>

<p>“Rub some dirt in when you’ve done, with a
touch of oil. But, there, I expect you know your
own job, Mr. Colson. Won’t you stay and have
tea?”</p>

<p>“I’m busy, thanks.”</p>

<p>Colson’s next rendezvous was his own home, a
pleasant little house a few minutes’ walk outside the
city walls. And the pleasant little house contained a
pleasant little wife, who bustled about to get tea.</p>

<p>“I was wondering if you’d be home to-day, Bob,”
she said.</p>

<p>“I shall have to be away to-night, my dear. This
is going to be a big case, I think.”</p>

<p>“Any progress?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“A little,” he said; “tell you all about it when
I’ve finished tea.”</p>

<p>No one else knew it, but Colson always took his
wife into his confidence. He knew the value of a
woman’s intuition. And many a time she had helped
him at his work with her quick wit.</p>

<p>So, seated by the fire, carefully cutting the stick
he had just bought with his knife, he told her all
that had happened.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea who did it, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest. But there are one or two
strong suspicions, eh?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“You think robbery was the motive?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it—if that little bag had more
diamonds in it.”</p>

<p>“But why should the thief not take the bag itself—and
why should he put it back in Mr. Templeton’s
waistcoat pocket?”</p>

<p>“Ask me another,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s another, then, Bob. Suppose we
grant that the murderer carried this stick. Why was
it in the dinghy. You yourself say he must have
taken another boat to get to the yacht, because the
dinghy was fast to her. How came that stick in
the dinghy then?”</p>

<p>“I know,” he said slowly. “And it’s puzzled me,
too.”</p>

<p>“Unless——”</p>

<p>“Unless what?”</p>

<p>“Unless Mr. Templeton took someone on board
first, someone who laid his walking-stick in the boat
while Mr. Templeton rowed him out, and left it
there when he was brought back to shore.”</p>

<p>Colson brought his hand down on his knee with a
smack.</p>

<p>“Good!” he ejaculated. “There may be something
in that. It might not belong to the murderer at
all. But I’ll test it, all the same.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” went on his wife, “which side of the
path were the prints of the stick?”</p>

<p>The detective looked at her with admiration.</p>

<p>“You see that, do you? Well done! They were
on the right-hand side as I walked into Frattenbury.
That’s what made me think—what I’ve proved
from Canon Fittleworth—that Templeton carried it.
A man generally carries his stick in his right hand.”</p>

<p>She smiled a little as she gazed into the fire,
pleased with the compliment.</p>

<p>He had finished cutting the stick now, and was
comparing it with the original. Then he rubbed in
some dirt and oil. The two sticks looked exactly
alike.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said his wife.</p>

<p>She handled them lightly.</p>

<p>“There’s a tiny knob just here,” and she showed
him it on the new stick.</p>

<p>“Bravo! One to you. I’ll have that off.”</p>

<p>With the most careful scrutiny they both
compared the two sticks. The work was completed.
Colson rose to go.</p>

<p>“Now, dear,” he said, “put some things for the
night into my bag and strap it on my bike, please.
I’ll be back presently. Also, strap on this stick.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wrap it up in brown paper first,” she said.
“You can’t be too careful.”</p>

<p>He kissed her, and went to the police station.
Nothing fresh had transpired. He left the stick he
had found on the dinghy at the station, wrote out
his report, talked over matters with the superintendent,
and finally went home to get his bicycle.</p>

<p>Colson was an exceedingly careful man, and
instead of taking the Marsh Quay road at once, he
started out of the city in the opposite direction and
rode by a circuitous route till he reached the southern
road by a by-way. When he came to the turning
that led to Marsh Quay, he put out his lamp and
rode carefully through the darkness, congratulating
himself when he reached the “Mariner’s Arms” that
he had not passed a single person.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates had provided a tempting supper of
cold meat, pickles, cheese and beer, and while the
detective was doing full justice to it, came into his
room.</p>

<p>“They’ve all gone now, sir,” she said; “there’s
no one else in the house.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Well, I suppose they talked
about the murder, eh?”</p>

<p>“Nothing else, Mr. Colson. A lot o’ rubbish they
talked, too. There’s nothing I overheard ’em say
that’s worth mentioning.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, now, look here, Mrs. Yates. I want
you to leave the front door on the latch, and if you
hear me go downstairs in the night, don’t you take
any notice, see?”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir. Anything more you want?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mrs. Yates; you can clear away.
Only, don’t take my glass. I haven’t finished your
excellent beer yet.”</p>

<p>When she had bid him good night, he lighted his
pipe and leaned back in his chair, thinking over the
events of the day, sipping his beer from time to
time. Presently he looked at his watch. It was a
little after ten. Taking a small piece of red glass
from his pocket, he lifted the lamp from the table
and approached the window with it. He held the
bit of glass in front of the lamp for a few minutes
and then put out the light.</p>

<p>He opened the window. It was a cloudy night and
very dark. He could hear Gadsden paddling himself
ashore, and could just discern a dim form as he
landed. Gadsden was making plenty of noise. He
lighted his bicycle lamp, mounted his machine, and
rode off, sounding his bell as he did so. Colson heard
him shout out “Good night” when he was a little
way down the road.</p>

<p>He sat by the window for some little time. Then,
first putting on a pair of rubber-soled tennis shoes,
and taking with him the stick he had brought from
Frattenbury, first unwrapping it from its brown
paper covering, he slipped quietly downstairs and
went out.</p>

<p>Very carefully picking his way, he went down to
the shore. It was a perfectly quiet night, the silence
only broken by the ripple of the tide flowing up the
estuary. He looked around him. Only one light was
burning—in a window of Mr. Proctor’s house. The
latter had evidently not yet gone to bed.</p>

<p>Colson unhitched the painter from the post, slowly,
without making a sound, launched the canoe, and
paddled out in silence. Arrived beside the dinghy,
he placed the walking-stick well under the seat,
where he had found the original, and returned just
as quietly to the shore.</p>

<p>Before he went back to the inn he took careful
stock of another canoe that was close to the shore,
and gave a nod of satisfaction. Then he returned to
his room and waited and watched.</p>

<p>As he had said, it was a forlorn hope and he
hardly expected that anything would come of it.
It was more than probable that the murderer was
miles away by this time. And yet, if that stick <em>had</em>
belonged to him, so far as Colson knew at present,
it was the only clue to the mystery. And whoever
had left it in the dinghy must know that as well.
The point that Colson was building upon was the
fact that the stick had been stowed away under the
seat of the dinghy and was not found on board the
yacht itself. If it belonged to the man who had
committed the crime, there was just the chance that
he might calculate that little notice had been taken
of the dinghy. And it would be worth something
to him to get it back.</p>

<p>It was some time after midnight that Colson gave
a start and stood tense at the window. A slight
sound had disturbed him. Straining his eyes through
the darkness, he could just discern a form apparently
bending over one of the canoes on the shore. Then
he saw the form straighten itself and walk a little
distance away. He lost sight of it, but in a few
moments it returned. Again it bent down.</p>

<p>“He’s unfastening the painter,” murmured the
detective. Then he could see a man get into the canoe,
and the next moment he could hear the slight splash
of a paddle. The unknown was making for the
yacht.</p>

<p>Colson felt the little automatic pistol he carried in
his pocket—he was taking no risks. Quickly he
made his way downstairs, opened the door and went
out, crouching low. It was his intention to get down
to the shore, lie hidden behind one of the boats,
and catch the unknown unawares as he landed. He
looked across the water. The canoe was alongside
the dinghy now. He had to act quickly to get to his
hiding-place.</p>

<p>Then the unlucky thing happened. He caught his
foot in a low post, and went sprawling on the stones
with a crash that rang out in the still night.
Colson swore roundly beneath his breath, picked
himself up, and rushed to the water’s edge. He
knew he was discovered. Then, to his dismay, he
heard the splash of the paddle and could just see the
canoe shooting out beyond the yacht into the estuary.</p>

<p>He rushed for one of the other canoes, whipped
out his knife, cut the painter, and pushed her into
the water. But as he stepped in he swore again.</p>

<p>“Confound my luck,” he muttered; “there’s no
paddle. <em>That’s</em> what he was up to.”</p>

<p>Looking out over the estuary, he saw the dim
form of the canoe and its occupant rapidly shooting
up with the tide towards Frattenbury. By the time
he had found the paddle—thrown on the grass thirty
yards away or so—it was too late. The tide was
running like a mill-stream.</p>

<p>Again cursing his bad luck, he paused for a minute
to reflect. What could he do? Nothing. The man
might land on either bank, or at the extremity of
the estuary—anywhere. For a moment he thought
of mounting his bicycle, but the only road it was
possible to ride was round by Frattenbury. To
attempt to follow up by running along the side of the
estuary in such a dark night would be equally
fruitless for fast going. The canoe would be running up
that tide race with great speed, and the occupant
had every chance of escaping. Marsh Quay had
neither telephone nor telegraph; it was impossible
to head him off by sending a message to the
Frattenbury police.</p>

<p>Colson shook his fist at the estuary, a disappointed
man. To make quite sure that the unknown had
come for the walking-stick he paddled out to the
dinghy. It was a foregone conclusion. There was
no stick there.</p>

<p>He returned to the inn. There was nothing more
to be done.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing, though,” he said as he
undressed; “I’ve got the original stick still, <em>and he
doesn’t know it</em>. That’s a point to me, and it may
mean that I’ll have him yet.”</p>

<p>Colson was one of those fortunate individuals who
can do with very little sleep. He woke at an early
hour, fresh and alert.</p>

<p>He glanced out of the window as he was dressing.</p>

<p>The tide was on the ebb. A canoe was out in
mid-stream, a man in her paddling down from the upper
reach. As he drew nearer and began to turn towards
the shore, the detective recognised him. It was Mr.
Proctor.</p>

<p>Hastily Colson slipped on the rest of his clothes,
and was on the shore just as Mr. Proctor came in.
The detective pursed up his lips as he recognised the
canoe. It was the one in which the unknown had
made his escape in the night.</p>

<p>Proctor was the first to speak as he stepped ashore.
He smiled and nodded affably.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” he said. “You’re an early bird,
Mr. Colson.”</p>

<p>“So are you,” retorted the detective dryly. “Been
out fishing?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the little man. “I’ve been rescuing
my canoe. Some joker seems to have played tricks
with it in the night.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the detective,
looking at him intently.</p>

<p>But the little man returned his gaze quite calmly.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, “my energetic young nephew
went out eel-spearing at some unearthly hour—to
catch the falling tide—walks on the mud, you know,
with what we call cleat boards fixed to his boots.
It’s a good place for eels further up the estuary.
About half a mile up he came on my canoe, stranded
on a ridge of stones. He couldn’t get her down to
the water by himself, so he ran home and woke me.
Now, I should like to know who took that canoe out
last night.”</p>

<p>The detective thought he would like to know also.</p>

<p>“I suppose it wasn’t you—or any of your police
people, eh?” went on the little man. “I know in
a case like this you’re up to all kinds of funny little
dodges.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Colson, “it wasn’t any of us. Our
man—Constable Gadsden—came back to Frattenbury
quite early last night. There was nothing to
keep him here.”</p>

<p>He looked hard again at Mr. Proctor as he spoke.
He was getting a little puzzled. But the other man
was apparently quite calm.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I’m going to get some breakfast.
I suppose you had yours before you came out
from Frattenbury this morning?”</p>

<p>It was an innocent enough question, but Colson
was on his guard.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, I didn’t,” he said. “I’m
going to see if I can get some at the ‘Mariner’s
Arms.’ ”</p>

<p>Proctor nodded and turned to go.</p>

<p>“One moment,” said the detective. “I should like
to see your nephew about finding that canoe this
morning.”</p>

<p>“What?” retorted Proctor, stopping and turning.
“Do you think there’s anything in it about the
murder?”</p>

<p>“I never said that. But it’s best to take notice
of anything, you know.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, come in after breakfast and
see him.”</p>

<p>The detective ate his meal in silence. There were
several matters which gave him food for his mind
as well as for his body. He was getting profoundly
dissatisfied with the course of events. When Mrs.
Yates came into the room to clear away he asked
her, casually, how long Mr. Proctor had been living
at Marsh Quay.</p>

<p>“About two years, sir. The house was for sale
then, and he came and bought it. A nice gentleman
he is, too.”</p>

<p>“Does he do anything?”</p>

<p>“Just a bit of boatin’ and fishin’, that’s all. He
ain’t got cause to work for his living. They say
he’s retired from his business, whatever it was I
dunno.”</p>

<p>“Married?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He’s a bachelor. Would you like a bit
o’ fish for your dinner, Mr. Colson? I can get some
nice fresh whiting.”</p>

<p>“Excellent, Mrs. Yates. Keep your mouth shut
about my sleeping here last night. If anyone’s
inquisitive, make ’em think I came out from
Frattenbury early this morning.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir.”</p>

<p>He strolled across to Mr. Proctor’s house. The
latter saw him coming through the window, and
opened the door for him.</p>

<p>“Can I offer you a smoke?” he said. “A
cigarette—or——”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I stick to my pipe. You don’t mind
my lighting up?”</p>

<p>“Go on—have some of this,” and he set a tobacco
jar on the table. “Now, Phil,” he went on to the
boy who was with him “you must tell the
detective-sergeant how you found my canoe this morning.”</p>

<p>Colson listened while the boy told his story, which
was brief and simple. And as he listened his gaze
strayed once or twice to a picture, a large framed
photograph, hanging over the mantelpiece. He asked
Philip a few questions.</p>

<p>“Was she fastened in any way?”</p>

<p>“No—just lying on the stones.”</p>

<p>“Just as she might have been left if anyone had
landed from her when the tide was up, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I see. I expect you know all about the tide here,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Then what time do you calculate the tide was
up to the spot where you found her?”</p>

<p>“That’s no use,” said Philip promptly. “You see,
if the fellow landed before high tide the flow would
go on washing the canoe up and leave her stranded
when it turned. I found her at highwater mark, of
course.”</p>

<p>The detective, who had his eyes riveted on Proctor’s
face while the boy was replying, smiled
approvingly.</p>

<p>“You’re a sharp lad,” he said. “I ought to have
thought of that. But it means that he landed either
at or before high tide, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said the boy.</p>

<p>Colson got up to go, lingering a little in the room.
He strolled up to the fire-place casually.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine view,” he said, nodding towards the
picture. “Looks like a bit of Switzerland.”</p>

<p>“It is,” replied Proctor. “It’s the Julier Pass,
just before you get into the Engadine.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I’ve always wanted to spend a holiday in
Switzerland, but I’ve never been able to run to it.
You’ve been there, I suppose?” he asked Proctor,
turning to him as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—some years ago.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, thank you very much, sir. I won’t
hinder you any longer.”</p>

<p>“I shall see you this afternoon,” said the little
man, in the act of showing him out. “I’m summoned
on the jury.”</p>

<p>Philip had come to the door with them. The
detective turned to him.</p>

<p>“Did you get good sport with the eels this
morning?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not so bad. It’s ripping sport. Have you tried
it?”</p>

<p>“No,” laughed the detective. “What sort of a
spear do you use?”</p>

<p>“Come along. I’ll show you. I left it in the
garden here.”</p>

<p>Colson followed him, examined the spear, chatting
as he did so.</p>

<p>“And you say about half a mile up yonder—near
the spot where you found the canoe—is the best
place for eels?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I always go there.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, if you get up so early you may
make your uncle think there’s a burglar in the
house—if he hears you about in the dark, you
know, eh?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t dark when I got up,” said the boy, a
little surprised, “and uncle knew I was going out this
morning early. I told him so last night.”</p>

<p>“Can’t quite make out that uncle of yours,” said
Colson to himself as he walked along. “I wonder if
he is only a fool.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII. <br> The Inquest</h2>

<p>The coroner arrived a little early, and was standing
on the shore with the Chief Constable and the
superintendent, the latter pointing out to him the
scene of the crime.</p>

<p>“Shocking, shocking!” he exclaimed in his dry,
formal manner. “I have your detailed report, Mr.
Superintendent. I suppose there’s nothing else I
ought to know before we begin?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope we shall catch the scoundrel,”
remarked the Chief Constable, giving a twist to his
moustache, as they turned away towards the inn.
“He deserves hanging if ever a man did.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. He does, indeed,” replied the coroner.
“That, of course, is <em>your</em> business. Mine is only
to ascertain the circumstances and the cause of
death.” He took out his watch. “It’s about time
we began,” he went on.</p>

<p>When the jury filed into the bar parlour after
viewing the body they found none too much space.
The room barely accommodated them, the police,
the witnesses, and representatives of the Press.
Outside the inn a little crowd of people had to be
content with waiting patiently.</p>

<p>The coroner took his seat at the top of the table,
near the fire-place, which was in an angle of the
room. Seated on his right, facing across the table,
and therefore at the other angle, was Mr. Proctor,
who had been elected by the jury as their foreman.
Facing the coroner sat the police and the doctor.
On one side of the room was a tall man with
clean-shaven face and a professional manner. He was
Mr. Anthony Crosby, the lawyer from London.</p>

<p>The coroner opened the proceedings formally by
explaining to the jury their duties, concluding by
saying:</p>

<p>“It will probably be necessary to adjourn this
inquiry, and in that case you will not be called
upon to record your verdict this afternoon. I think,
from what I have said, you will quite understand
that the scope of this inquiry is limited to the actual
cause of death and circumstances which may throw
light upon such cause. Of course, if anything
transpires which may assist the police in their
investigations, I shall exercise my prerogative in
allowing it to be brought forward. But the jury are
not concerned with police investigations other than
those which threw light upon the actual cause of
death. I hope I make myself plain?”</p>

<p>And he turned an inquiring look upon Mr. Proctor.</p>

<p>The little man nodded his bald head.</p>

<p>“I think I can say on behalf of the jury, sir,
that we all understand perfectly.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the coroner. “Now we can
proceed with the inquiry.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Anthony Crosby rose from his seat
and said:</p>

<p>“I represent the late Mr. Templeton, sir—as his
legal adviser.”</p>

<p>“Your name?” asked the coroner.</p>

<p>“Mr. Anthony Crosby, of Crosby and Paxton,
17<span class="sc">b</span>, Lincoln’s Inn Fields.”</p>

<p>The coroner bowed and made a note of it.</p>

<p>The first witness called was Jim Webb, who gave
evidence of the discovery of the body early on the
previous morning. The coroner asked him a few
questions.</p>

<p>“You say that the deceased had arranged to go
into Frattenbury on the Saturday afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And that you were given the night off?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, did you know whom he was going to
see?”</p>

<p>“The Reverend Fittleworth, sir. I guessed it
afterwards.”</p>

<p>The coroner elevated his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“<em>Guessed</em> it? What do you mean? How did
you guess it?”</p>

<p>The man explained that he had read Canon
Fittleworth’s name and address on the letter he
had posted for his master.</p>

<p>“Were you in the habit of prying into Mr.
Templeton’s correspondence?” asked the coroner
sarcastically.</p>

<p>Jim Webb reddened.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I wasn’t,” he replied emphatically.</p>

<p>“Oh! How many more names and addresses did
you read?”</p>

<p>“Not any, sir. As a matter of fact that was the
only letter he ever gave me to post.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure? Remember you are on oath.”</p>

<p>“Quite sure, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>Anthony Crosby interposed just as Webb was
about to stand down.</p>

<p>“May I put a question to the witness?”</p>

<p>“Yes—if you wish. It should be done through
me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. Will you ask him if he can
give an account of his actions from Saturday evening
till Sunday morning?”</p>

<p>“You hear the question,” said the coroner to
Webb; “what have you to say?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can,” said the man, a little indignantly.
“I was in my uncle’s house at Frattenbury.
I can bring three witnesses to prove that.”</p>

<p>“Are you satisfied?” the coroner asked Crosby.</p>

<p>“Perfectly, thank you.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be grateful for that question,”
said the coroner to Webb, who was muttering
something; “it clears you in the eyes of the jury
of any connection with the crime. Next witness,
please.”</p>

<p>The next witness was the doctor, who gave his
evidence tersely and technically. Several times
the coroner had to ask him to explain surgical terms
to the jury.</p>

<p>“How long do you consider he had been dead?”
asked the coroner.</p>

<p>“Some hours—I would not undertake to say
precisely how many.”</p>

<p>“Well—before or after midnight?”</p>

<p>“Probably before. Possibly after.”</p>

<p>“You will not commit yourself?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You think he was stabbed with a knife?”</p>

<p>“I do not. I consider that the weapon was more
in the form of a dagger. The wound was distinctly
triangular.”</p>

<p>“And that death was instantaneous?”</p>

<p>“Death was instantaneous.”</p>

<p>“There were no signs of a struggle?”</p>

<p>“None. I am of opinion that the deceased was
probably seated on the bunk, leaning towards the
table, that he fell forward, struck his head against
the table, and then pitched onto the floor of the
cabin. There was a slight abrasion on the left
temple which makes this probable.”</p>

<p>After one or two further questions the doctor
resumed his seat. He was followed by Tom Gale,
who gave evidence as to the arrival of the yacht
and the crossing of the estuary by the murdered
man. When he had finished, the coroner addressed
the superintendent.</p>

<p>“You have this matter in hand?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We have, sir. I should like to suggest that it
is strictly a question for the police at this moment.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the coroner. “The jury will
please note it. It may have a bearing on the case
at a further stage of the inquiry. I think that is
what you mean?”</p>

<p>“Quite so, sir,” replied the superintendent.
“Thank you.”</p>

<p>The superintendent himself was next called upon.
Briefly and clearly he described his visit to the
yacht the previous morning, corroborating the
non-technical portion of the doctor’s evidence. The
coroner leaned back in his chair, the tips of his
fingers together, and thought for a moment. Then
he said:</p>

<p>“A thorough investigation of the cabin was made,
I presume?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I placed it in the hands of
Detective-Sergeant Colson.”</p>

<p>“Is there any matter in connection with that
investigation which you consider the jury ought to
know?”</p>

<p>“At present, sir, I would rather not advance any
information—except to say that there is nothing
which would assist the jury in arriving at their
verdict. And I ask for an adjournment of the inquiry
when all the witnesses called to-day have been
heard.”</p>

<p>The coroner nodded.</p>

<p>“That is quite reasonable,” he said, “quite
reasonable.”</p>

<p>Mr. Crosby rose.</p>

<p>“In my position,” he said, “I should naturally
wish further questions to be put to the witness, but
I shall be perfectly satisfied if I have an
assurance from the police that they will give me any
information which may be of use to me.”</p>

<p>“You will do this?” asked the coroner.</p>

<p>“Most certainly,” replied the superintendent.
“Our wish is only that certain details may not
become public.”</p>

<p>The next witness was Canon Fittleworth. He
had known the coroner for years, fairly intimately,
and he smiled a little as that functionary asked his
name, address and occupation as though he were
an entire stranger. He told the jury the facts he
had already put before the superintendent. Rather
a lengthy examination followed, in the course of
which the coroner asked him:</p>

<p>“You say the deceased informed you he had
business with someone in Frattenbury on Saturday
night?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“You do not know with whom?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He did not tell you?”</p>

<p>“He did not.”</p>

<p>“He did not drop any hint?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You knew Mr. Templeton fairly intimately—didn’t
he mention anyone he knew in Frattenbury?
It is an important point.”</p>

<p>“I did not know him very intimately. I hadn’t
seen him for some years. So far as I am aware, he
knew no one in Frattenbury except myself and
family.”</p>

<p>“You have no idea what this business was that
he mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘not exactly’?”</p>

<p>The coroner was looking at the Canon keenly.
The jury were interested.</p>

<p>“Only that, in the course of conversation, he
mentioned that he was glad to be getting rid of
something valuable he had been carrying about for
a long time.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say.”</p>

<p>“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Canon Fittleworth. That will do.
You will allow me—and I am sure the jury will
join me in this—you will allow us to express our
very deep sympathy towards you and our family
in this terrible tragedy.”</p>

<p>The Canon bowed.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said. “There is—er—a statement
I wish to make—something in the way of
evidence.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the coroner.</p>

<p>“When I went on board the yacht yesterday
morning there was something I found in the
cabin—something I ought, perhaps, to have given to the
police—but my mind was so much agitated at the
time.”</p>

<p>The superintendent and Colson looked up quickly.
The coroner asked sharply:</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“A band off a cigar—lying on the floor of the
cabin—here it is,” and he laid it on the table.</p>

<p>The jury leaned forward—it was a moment of
intense interest—the coroner motioned for the cigar
band to be passed to him, took and examined it.
Then he sat still thinking, leaning back in his chair,
his head bent down. Then he said:</p>

<p>“You think this important?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because my cousin did not smoke. He told me
so on Saturday evening.”</p>

<p>The coroner sat bolt upright in his chair, a frown
on his face, his eyes literally glaring at the Canon.</p>

<p>“The jury must see this. Pass it round,” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then he went on with great severity:</p>

<p>“You must forgive my saying, Canon Fittleworth,
that I consider you have behaved in an
exceedingly careless manner. I have no doubt that
you did not think—as you say—but a man of your
intelligence ought to have thought. This should
have been handed to the police immediately. It is
just such want of thought that often leads to grave
hindrances of justice. I am sorry to have to say
this, but, in my position here, it is only my duty.”</p>

<p>He had leaned forward as he spoke, his elbows
on the table. As he resumed his former upright
position, his right elbow swept one or two papers
off the table. They fell fluttering into the fire-place.
He leaned over to the right to pick them up, but
before he could do so the foreman of the jury went
down on one knee to assist him.</p>

<p>The coroner picked up one bit of paper, Proctor
the rest.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said the coroner as the foreman
handed them to him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the cigar band was being passed from
man to man of the jury. Each of them examined
it solemnly and portentously, one or two shaking
their heads with an air of profound wisdom. So it
went round till it reached the foreman, and his
examination was the longest of all. He pursed up
his little round mouth, adjusted a pair of spectacles
on his nose, and looked carefully at the little red
and gold object. Finally, as though loath to part
with it, he handed it to two of the jurymen across
the table who had not yet seen it, and they passed
it on to the coroner.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Canon was standing with burning
face. It was a new and humiliating experience for
a cathedral dignitary to be soundly rated in public,
and though, in his heart of hearts, he admitted the
justice of it, he was exceedingly irritated.</p>

<p>“I much regret,” he said stiffly, and a little
pompously—“I much regret what you are pleased to call
my indiscretion, but I am not accustomed to
experiences of this nature. I can say no more.”</p>

<p>“Have you anything to add?” asked the coroner,
relenting a little, but still stern.</p>

<p>If the worthy Canon had been feeling normal he
might have said more. But he was so acutely concerned
with what he considered an undignified
situation that he merely remarked:</p>

<p>“Nothing. Except that the brand is that of a
particular cigar which I smoke myself.”</p>

<p>It was here that the foreman of the jury
interposed:</p>

<p>“May I ask a question?”</p>

<p>But the coroner, after a moment’s thought, said:</p>

<p>“You may ask me to put a question if you
please, but in the interests of the case I imagine the
police would rather you did not.”</p>

<p>And the Chief Constable, who had been in
whispered consultation with the superintendent and
Colson, immediately exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Thank you. We much prefer that no questions
should be asked. We consider this matter as strictly
belonging to the police—at this stage of the inquiry.”</p>

<p>“I think it does,” replied the coroner. “I shall
hand over this cigar band to you, of course.”</p>

<p>And he laid it on the table. There was one man
who never took his eyes off it for a moment, and
that was the detective, who put it in his pocket-case
a minute or two later when the inquiry was formally
adjourned.</p>

<p>“You may stand down, Canon Fittleworth,” said
the coroner stiffly. “Are there any more witnesses?”</p>

<p>There were none.</p>

<p>“You ask for an adjournment,” said the coroner
to the superintendent, “for how long?”</p>

<p>“This day fortnight, sir.”</p>

<p>The coroner consulted his diary. “Will Saturday
week do?” he asked. “I have a case in court on
the Monday.”</p>

<p>“That will do very well, sir,” replied the
superintendent.</p>

<p>The majority pressed out of the tap-room, Colson
and Anthony Crosby being among the few who
remained. The doctor, who had motored Canon
Fittleworth over to Marsh Quay, was in a hurry to
get back. As the latter got into the car, the
superintendent came up and said, more in sorrow than
in anger:</p>

<p>“You ought to have given us that cigar band at
once, really you ought, sir.”</p>

<p>“I know I ought,” said the Canon, whose injured
pride was beginning to thaw. “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“I’ll call later on, if I may—or Colson will—we
shall want to see your particular brand of cigars.”</p>

<p>“Do!”</p>

<p>But when Colson and the superintendent made a
closer examination of that cigar band, they agreed
that it might not be worth while troubling the
worthy Canon.</p>

<p>“These parsons aren’t much help,” said Colson
sarcastically; “they’d best stick to preaching and
not mix themselves up in our business. Bother the
blighter! I say.”</p>

<p>“I say—how did you manage to miss that cigar
band, on the yacht?” asked the superintendent.</p>

<p>“I can tell you exactly, sir. I made my examination
while the body was on the floor. When they
came to lay it out on the table I went on deck—I
was still there when you and the Canon came aboard,
you remember? I made a further examination
afterwards, but that band must have been under
Templeton’s body in the first place. That would account
for the Canon finding it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII. <br> Winnie Cotterill Pays a Visit to Frattenbury</h2>

<p>“Hurry up, Winnie, breakfast is all ready.”</p>

<p>“All right,” came a voice from somewhere, “I’ll
be with you in a minute. You begin—don’t wait
for me.”</p>

<p>Maude Wingrave seated herself at the breakfast
table and poured out a cup of tea. It was a tiny
room, high up in a block of flats, looking over
Battersea Park. The girl who sat at the table was
short and dark-haired, with a merry expression on
her somewhat plain face.</p>

<p>“You are the limit, Winnie,” she exclaimed as
a newcomer entered the room, a girl of about five
and twenty, with a fresh, clear-cut face and grey
eyes. “You’re a downright lazy pig.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it. I simply <em>hate</em> getting up. What’s
for breakfast? I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“Go on—help yourself. Do something towards
running this establishment, if it’s only <em>that</em>. I’ve
not too much time. Can’t look after you.”</p>

<p>And she glanced at her wrist-watch.</p>

<p>“You ought to be thankful, Winnie Cotterill, that
you don’t have to keep office hours.”</p>

<p>“I am,” replied Winnie. “Providence never
intended me to be punctual, so Providence has
provided me with work that doesn’t need a 9 a.m.
beginning each day. Pass the toast.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing to-day?”</p>

<p>“Finishing the cover of the Christmas number of
<i>Peter’s Magazine</i>, my dear, and I’m thankful to
get it off my hands. Then I’m going seriously to
tackle that short story the editor of <i>The Holborn</i>
sent me to illustrate. A ‘horrible murder,’ Maude.
With a detective in it. I’m going to make him a
little ugly, snubbed-nose creature, wearing big
police boots. True to life, my dear—none of your
impossible Sherlock Holmes.”</p>

<p>The other girl laughed.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an interview with our new ‘serial’ this
morning,” she said—“a great big man of fifty, with
a solemn beard and spectacles. He’s selling us the
most romantic piffle you ever read. There’ll be a
boom in our issue when the servant girls get hold
of it. Hand over the paper if you’re not using it.
I want to glance at the news before I go.”</p>

<p>Winnie Cotterill passed the newspaper to her
friend. Maude Wingrave opened it.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” she exclaimed, “talk about your story
with a ‘horrible murder’ in it—here’s a real one!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Maude read out the head-lines:</p>

<p>“<i>Mysterious Crime.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Yachtsman Murdered on Board His Yacht.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Inquest To-day.</i>”</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Winnie, as she reached over
for the teapot.</p>

<p>Maude began to read:</p>

<blockquote class="article">

  <p>“Early yesterday morning a shocking discovery
  was made on board a small yacht, anchored in the
  little harbour of Marsh Quay, on an estuary of the
  Channel, about two miles from the cathedral city
  of Frattenbury. Mr. Reginald Templeton, a Fellow
  of the Royal Geographical Society, only lately
  returned from South Africa——”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Winnie Cotterill dropped her knife and fork on
her plate.</p>

<p>“Who?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Reginald Templeton. Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Pass me the paper. It must be—yes—it
<em>is</em>—murdered! Oh, Maude!”</p>

<p>“Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I do! Ever since I can remember.
He was a great friend of my mother, and
always so kind to me. I always called him Uncle.
Why, I only had a letter from him last week. He
was coming to London, soon, he said.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor dear! Are you <em>sure</em> it’s the same
man, Winnie?”</p>

<p>“It must be,” said the girl, looking at the paper
again. “Yes—when he wrote he said he was
yachting on the South Coast. Oh, Maude, what am I
to do?”</p>

<p>Maude had risen from the seat and was looking
over her friend’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Look,” she said, pointing with her finger, “he’d
been dining the night before with his cousin, Canon
Fittleworth. Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard Uncle speak of him. No, I’ve never
met him.”</p>

<p>“Why not write to him—or telegraph?”</p>

<p>Winnie shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she replied. “Of course, you
see, Mr. Templeton isn’t any relation of mine. But
I was awfully fond of him. Poor old Uncle! I
know what I <em>will</em> do, dear,” she went on
impulsively.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I <em>must</em> finish that cover this morning. But
I’ll go down to Frattenbury this afternoon and see
Canon Fittleworth—yes, I will.”</p>

<p>Maude had glanced at her watch again, and was
putting on her gloves.</p>

<p>“Will it be any good?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, Maude, I <em>must</em>! He’s been so awfully good
to me. Why, my dear, when my mother died, and
there wasn’t a penny, it was Mr. Templeton who
paid for my art training. I owe my living to
him—really. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>Maude nodded her head sympathetically.</p>

<p>“I know, dear. I should do just the same. I’m
<em>so</em> sorry. Yes—go down to Frattenbury. I wish I
could go with you, but I simply <em>have</em> to get to the
office.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about me, dear. I shall take a
handbag in case I stay the night—I can get a room
at an hotel. I’ll wire and let you know if I’m not
coming back this evening.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I’d like to know. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>And she nodded brightly as she left the room to
go to her work. She was sub-editress of one of the
many popular weeklies issued by a well-known firm
of publishers and newspaper proprietors. The two
“bachelor” girl friends had been sharing the same
flat for nearly a year.</p>

<p>Winnie Cotterill slowly finished her breakfast,
reading the details of the tragedy as she did so—a
couple of columns in the usual blaring journalistic
style, followed by a short article on local police
methods, detrimental, of course, to the said local
police. She was getting into a calmer frame of mind
now, though still much upset by the shock of
hearing such unexpected news.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, she went into the little adjacent
room she dignified by the name of “studio” and
got to work on the magazine cover. When it was
finished, she took a bus to Fleet Street and
deposited it with her editor, in whose office she
consulted a Bradshaw.</p>

<p>She had already packed a small handbag and,
after a light lunch at a restaurant, she caught the
afternoon train to Frattenbury, arriving about six,
and at once made her way to the Close.</p>

<p>Canon Fittleworth was closeted in his study with
Anthony Crosby, who had returned from Marsh
Quay and was staying the night at an hotel. A maid
announced the fact that a young lady wished to see
the Canon, and handed him a visiting card on a
salver.</p>

<p>The Canon adjusted his pince-nez and read the
name out loud.</p>

<p>“Miss Winifred Cotterill.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” interjaculated the lawyer, looking up from
some papers he was studying.</p>

<p>“Miss Winifred Cotterill,” repeated the Canon.
“I don’t know her.”</p>

<p>“But I do,” said Anthony Crosby, “at least, I
know of her. She is, in a way, connected with this
case, and I was going to communicate with her as
soon as I got back to London.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, in that case, we’ll see her together.
Show Miss Cotterill in, Jane.”</p>

<p>The Canon looked her over quickly as she
entered. He was, for the moment, half afraid that
there might have been some unpleasant incident in
his cousin’s life, with some undesirable female
connected with it. His suspicions were quickly
removed. He saw a neatly-dressed girl with a refined
and pleasant face, and took a step towards her.</p>

<p>“Miss Cotterill?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I must apologise. I came down to
Frattenbury because—because I read about Mr.
Templeton’s murder in the paper this morning, and
you are his cousin, and——”</p>

<p>“Now do sit down, Miss Cotterill,” interrupted
the Canon, “and before I ask you anything
else—have you had any tea?”</p>

<p>“I’ve only just arrived,” replied the girl.</p>

<p>“I thought so. Now, I’m going to ring for tea.
I’m sure you want some, and then you can tell us
all about it. Mr. Crosby,” and he waved his hand
in introduction towards the lawyer, “heard your
name when it was announced, and says he knows
of you.”</p>

<p>Winnie Cotterill looked surprised.</p>

<p>“You know me?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard about you, Miss Cotterill,” said the
lawyer. “You see, I had the privilege of being a
friend of Mr. Templeton, as well as his legal
adviser, and he mentioned you several times. I quite
understand what a shock this terrible affair must be
to you.”</p>

<p>“He was most awfully kind to me,” said the
girl, her voice quavering a little, “and I felt I must
come down and find out more about it.”</p>

<p>Anthony Crosby nodded sympathetically. The
maid brought in tea. Winnie Cotterill explained
how Mr. Templeton had been a friend of her mother,
and what he had done for her. Then she listened
while the Canon told her about the murder.</p>

<p>“But why, <em>why</em> was he murdered?” she asked.
“I can’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear young lady,” said the Canon, “that
is what we all want to know. We suspect that
robbery was the cause of it and, of course, the police
have it in hand. Now tell me,” and he looked at his
watch, “I naturally take an interest in any friend of
my poor cousin. Were you thinking of going back
to London to-night? I ask because the funeral will
take place to-morrow afternoon—the coroner has
given an order for burial—and I thought you might
like to be present.”</p>

<p>“I should, very much,” replied the girl, “and
I’ll get a bed at an hotel for to-night. Perhaps you
can tell me of one?”</p>

<p>She had risen to go.</p>

<p>“Sit down and have another cup of tea,” said the
Canon with a smile. “I’ll be back in a minute or
two.”</p>

<p>He came back with his wife. Mrs. Fittleworth
greeted the girl warmly.</p>

<p>“You poor thing!” she said; “my husband has
just told me about you. I’m so sorry. But you
mustn’t think of going to an hotel. Do let us put
you up for the night.”</p>

<p>“It’s very kind of you.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. Of course you will stay with us.
Come along, you must be very tired.”</p>

<p>She took the girl out of the room, and the two
men were left together. The Canon looked inquiringly
at Anthony Crosby. The latter took a cigarette
from his case, tapped it deliberately, lighted
it, and began.</p>

<p>“I was going to tell you about Miss Cotterill,
anyhow,” he said. “From all I have gathered, you
know very little of your late cousin?”</p>

<p>“Very little indeed. I so rarely saw him. And
he was a reticent man. I really know nothing at
all about his affairs.”</p>

<p>The lawyer nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed, “he was distinctly reticent,
I know. I suppose <em>I</em> know as much as anyone,
and that isn’t a great deal. Now, about this
girl—I speak in confidence, of course?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, Templeton—like most men—had a
romance in his life.”</p>

<p>“He never married.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the lawyer deliberately, “the other
man did that—it was years ago now.”</p>

<p>“Who was the woman?” asked the Canon, his
curiosity aroused.</p>

<p>“This girl’s mother,” replied Crosby. “That is
as much as he told me. She was left a widow when
Winifred was about five years old—as far as I
understand.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he marry her then?”</p>

<p>The lawyer smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“I always consider that parsons, doctors and we
lawyers have more chances of knowing about
human nature than the rest of the world. And you
ought to know that very often when a man doesn’t
get his first chance of marrying the woman he loves,
he won’t take a second chance when it comes. That’s
the only answer I can give you.”</p>

<p>“Yes—it’s often true,” said the Canon
thoughtfully. “I’ve seen it more than once.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Well, the fact remains that Templeton
didn’t marry Mrs. Cotterill. But he stood by
her and her child. The girl has told you he paid
for her training as an art student.”</p>

<p>The Canon nodded.</p>

<p>“Just so. Well, before he went abroad to South
Africa he came to me and asked me to draw up his
will. I have it at my office. If there isn’t a later
one, of course, it stands good for probate.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>Crosby flicked the ash off his cigarette and
smiled at the Canon.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you won’t benefit by it,” he said.</p>

<p>Canon Fittleworth laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s no disappointment,” he replied; “I never
expected anything.”</p>

<p>“Then I hope that, as his nearest relative, as I
suppose you are, you won’t be envious when I tell
you he has left everything he possesses to this
girl—Winifred Cotterill.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said Canon Fittleworth. “No, I’m not
a bit envious. The girl is an orphan, and I’m only
too glad. Besides, after what you tell me, it’s
perfectly natural. Romance has a strange sway over
human affairs.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the other slowly and deliberately,
“unless Templeton made anything out of his last
venture—which I doubt—it won’t be very
much—not two thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>“I see—I knew nothing of his affairs. But I
always imagined him to be comfortably off.”</p>

<p>“He should have been—but for my profession,”
said the lawyer. “No, don’t blame me. I did
the best I could for him, but he would not listen to
reason. He got involved, some years ago, in an
unfortunate and expensive lawsuit—a question of
adjacent properties. I advised him, at the time, to
compromise, but he was adamant. The case went
against him, and he insisted upon carrying it to the
Court of Appeal. The appeal was quashed—as I
knew it would be. The costs were enormous—he
insisted on having the best counsel—and he had
to sell the whole of his property to pay them. The
other man bought the property, and Templeton never
forgave him.”</p>

<p>“I remember hearing something about it at the
time,” said the Canon. “So that was why he sold
the little place in Buckinghamshire! What a pity!
I suppose he was in the wrong, though?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that,” replied the other dryly. “It
was a case of law. And I admit that the law is not
always just. Anyhow, he became a comparatively
poor man. Besides, he spent what money he had
on travelling. An explorer, out on his own, can’t
expect to make money unless he discovers a
gold-mine. And Templeton didn’t. Even if he had, he’d
not the business capacity to make anything out of
it. Poor chap! ‘De mortuis,’ eh?”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said the Canon. After a silence he
remarked:</p>

<p>“Are you going to tell the girl—now?”</p>

<p>Anthony Crosby shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not for the moment,” he replied. “I prefer to
act professionally. As a matter of fact, I didn’t
bring the will. It’s at my office, and I had to come
straight down here from my home. Besides, there’s
a sealed packet that Templeton handed me just
before he sailed—only to be opened by me in the
event of his death. It may contain a codicil, or even
another will. So it wouldn’t be fair to tell her yet,
you see. You won’t say anything about it, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I won’t. Must you be going now?”</p>

<p>For the lawyer had risen.</p>

<p>“I must. I’m staying at the ‘Dolphin,’ and I’ve
some letters to write. I shall see you to-morrow—at
the funeral. I want to have a consultation with
the police in the morning.”</p>

<p>It was about ten o’clock that evening that the
Canon, who had retired to his study after dinner,
came into the drawing-room. His wife and daughter
and Winnie Cotterill were seated there.</p>

<p>“Who was with you in the study, dear?” asked
his wife. “I heard Jane showing someone in.”</p>

<p>“Major Renshaw,” replied her husband, seating
himself. “He came in to have a smoke and discuss
the events of the day.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fittleworth glanced swiftly at Winnie
Cotterill. With a woman’s instinct she knew the girl
had had nearly enough strain that day. She was
just going to try to turn the conversation when the
Canon went on in his best parsonical manner that
brooked no interruption:</p>

<p>“Of course, I refrained from asking him very
much about any possible clues, and so on,” he said.
“The police naturally wish to keep these things to
themselves. But he did tell me something, which
isn’t exactly private, because it’s being talked about
at Marsh Quay. There was a young man lodging
at the inn there—the ‘Mariner’s Arms.’ An artist,
apparently, though no one seems to know anything
about him.”</p>

<p>“Go on, father,” said Doris; “this sounds most
exciting.”</p>

<p>“Well, the strange thing is that he left quite
suddenly yesterday morning—just before the unhappy
affair was discovered. The landlady says he
came downstairs very early and announced his
intention of leaving at once.”</p>

<p>The three women were listening intently. The
Canon went on:</p>

<p>“He was, it seems, cycling into Frattenbury. But
he never went there. The police have been making
inquiries, and only found out this evening that he
stayed last night at Selham—three miles from Marsh
Quay down the estuary, you know. He left there
this morning, so they say, and must have been close
to Marsh Quay, because he was seen riding in the
direction of Frattenbury. Then all trace of him was
lost again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, daddy, how exciting! Do they think he
committed the murder?”</p>

<p>“Well, Renshaw didn’t say that—but, of course,
it’s suspicious going off like that, and the police are
making every effort to find him. They have his
description, and it shouldn’t be difficult.”</p>

<p>“Do they know his name?” asked Mrs.
Fittleworth.</p>

<p>“They know the name under which he stayed at
the inn,” replied the Canon, “but, of course, it may
be a fictitious one.”</p>

<p>“What is it, daddy?”</p>

<p>“Grayson—Harold Grayson.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>They all turned towards Winnie Cotterill, from
whom the exclamation proceeded. The girl was
sitting bolt upright in her chair, her hands
clutching at its arms, her face deadly pale.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Mrs. Fittleworth, crossing
over to her.</p>

<p>“Oh—it can’t be,” said Winnie in a low voice,
half choking. “He couldn’t have done it—I know
he couldn’t have done it.”</p>

<p>“What—do you know him?” asked the Canon
anxiously.</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>“If it’s the same—Mr. Grayson. Yes. He was at
the Art School with me. And I’ve seen him since.
I—I know him quite well. It’s impossible. Oh,
oughtn’t I to tell the police? It’s dreadful to think
of.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fittleworth, who noticed the deep blush to
which the girl’s ashy cheeks had given place, with a
motherly instinct put her arm over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, dear,” she said. “The Canon has
said the police don’t necessarily suspect him. If he
is really the Mr. Grayson you know—and he may
not be, after all—of course he will be able to explain.
You’re quite done up with all this terrible affair,
and I’m going to take you to bed. Come along.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Winnie gratefully, “you are
kind to me. I’m very silly, I know, but I can’t
bear to think that he—he is suspected. I know he
couldn’t have done it.”</p>

<p>“Of course he couldn’t,” said Mrs. Fittleworth
soothingly. “Now—I must insist. You come to
bed, dear.”</p>

<p>When the Canon himself went to bed that night
he had to listen to a little lecture. And he took it
calmly—from force of habit—much more calmly
than if it had come from the Dean, or even the
Bishop. Whereat it is evident that even for cathedral
dignitaries there is a higher court than the mere
ecclesiastical.</p>

<p>“Really, Charles,” said his wife, “you ought to
have noticed that the poor girl had gone through
quite enough for one day.”</p>

<p>The Canon tried defensive argument, which was
foolish of him—for he ought to have remembered
that he never succeeded.</p>

<p>“But how was I to know, my dear, that she was
acquainted with the young man?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do be reasonable, Charles. You ought not
to have mentioned the subject of the murder at all
at that time of night. Doris and I had been doing
our best to get the girl’s mind off it. And then you
came in and started it all again!”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you stop me, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Stop you!” exclaimed his wife; “stop you when
you once begin to hold forth on a subject. How can
anyone stop you? <em>I</em> can’t. There. I know you
didn’t mean to upset her, but you ought to have
thought.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought,” said the Canon resignedly.
“I’m very sorry. Good night, my dear.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX. <br> The Cigar Band</h2>

<p>The crowd that had assembled at the inquest at
Marsh Quay loitered for a while discussing the one
important topic. Newspaper men were busy with
notebook and camera. The removal of the body of
Reginald Templeton from the “Mariner’s Arms” to
the mortuary at Frattenbury, pending the funeral
the next day, was eagerly watched. Members of the
jury, for the most part stolid agricultural labourers
or boatmen, were closely questioned by friends or
relatives, but, on the whole, recognising the
importance of their office, were not communicative.</p>

<p>Mr. Proctor refused to say a word to anyone. He
came out of the “Mariner’s Arms,” lighting a cigar
as he did so, and walked straight over to his house
opposite, blandly smiling at an irrepressible
reporter who asked him to pose for his camera.</p>

<p>The coroner drove away with the Chief Constable
in the latter’s car, austere and grave as usual.
Anthony Crosby, the superintendent and Colson held
a brief consultation in the inn parlour, where it was
arranged that the lawyer should call at the police
station the next morning for further discussion.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, Colson?” asked the
superintendent as he rose to go. “Are you coming
back to Frattenbury?”</p>

<p>“I want to think a bit, sir. I may cycle in later
on. But I’m fairly puzzled just now. There are
two men we want to get hold of, anyhow—this artist
chap who was staying here, and Moss, opposite.”</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded.</p>

<p>“We’re bound to do that,” he said. “I expect
there’ll be reports when I get back to the station.
Well, I’ll leave you now.”</p>

<p>Everyone else but the detective having left the
inn, Mrs. Yates locked the front door and came into
the bar parlour.</p>

<p>“Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. Colson?”</p>

<p>“Yes, please. I should like some strong tea.
Then I want you to keep everyone away.”</p>

<p>“Trust me for that, sir. Not a soul comes into
this house till six, when I’m bound to open. I
want to have a little quiet myself, Mr. Colson. What
with all these reporters and people asking questions
I’m fairly bewildered. I hope there won’t be
any more murders here as long as I keeps the
‘Mariner’s Arms,’ I do indeed.”</p>

<p>Seated at the table, drinking his tea, his notebook
in front of him, Detective-Sergeant Colson
deliberately and methodically reviewed the case,
making his deductions as he did so, and writing them
out concisely. And this was the result when he
finally closed his pocket-book:</p>

<p>“<i>Templeton’s object in coming to Marsh Quay.</i>
First, to see Moss. That requires investigation.
Secondly, to see his cousin. We know all about
that. Thirdly, an interview with some unknown
person in Frattenbury, who must have been the last
person who saw him before he was murdered. Why
did not that person come forward to give evidence?
But he might not have lived in Frattenbury itself——he
might have spoken, loosely, of the neighbourhood.
He might have arranged to see Moss again—or
this artist chap—or even Proctor. They are all
possible.</p>

<p>“<i>Reason for appointment.</i> He hinted that he
was carrying something valuable. We know what
that was. Diamonds. There were probably more
than the one we found. Who has them now?</p>

<p>“<i>Clues.</i> Only four at present of any
value—possibly only two. (1) The blotting-paper. Not
easy to make out. If deciphered, it might lead to
finding out with whom the appointment was made,
or what it was about. But very uncertain. (2)
The diamond. But that only appears to prove
that he had others. (3) The walking-stick. Most
important, this. It is pretty certain that the man
who thinks he has recovered it is the criminal. If
only I hadn’t muddled it! (4) The cigar band. I
ought to have spotted that, and not have left it to
that confounded parson to find. There may be
something in it, certainly.</p>

<p>“<i>Possible suspects.</i> (1) Moss. Why did he leave
in such a hurry? The fact of the murderer being
on the spot last night, when he got that walking-stick,
seems to rule Moss out. But not necessarily.
He might easily have run down from London last
night. There’s a lot to be inquired into here.
(2) Grayson, the artist. Why did he leave in a
hurry? He’s certainly got to be run to earth.
(3) Proctor. Yes—Proctor puzzles me. Such a
cool old chap! He would have known exactly
where to land in that canoe—and, if so, he knew
perfectly well that the boy would find it there in
the morning. Also, he’s been in Switzerland. That
stick again! And I thought he was never going to
leave off examining that cigar band at the inquest.
We must keep a sharp eye on Proctor. If he’s not
simply a fool, he’s as wily as they make ’em.”</p>

<p>When he had closed his notebook and put it in
his pocket, the detective lighted his pipe and sat,
smoking thoughtfully, looking out of the window.
He realised that the case was all the more difficult
because the few clues that he held, and the slight
facts he had to go upon, might equally apply to any
one of the three persons he had enumerated as being
suspicious. And if, as it seemed, his work was
to eliminate two of these persons, he was anxious to
make no mistake.</p>

<p>Colson was not the detective of fiction. He was
simply a shrewd, careful man, keenly observant,
with a police training. Had he been that brilliant
genius which the writer of fiction is so fond of
delineating, he would, after his manner, by this time
have made some supernaturally clever deduction,
which would have enabled him to spot the criminal
at once, and to run him down unerringly, with the
additional triumph attached to it that all his
colleagues, and every other person concerned, had been
absolutely wrong in their suspicions. He would,
probably, have adopted extraordinary disguises, kept
all his clues and methods to himself, and never have
given a hint of them to his superior officers, and
finally have achieved that superlative climax in
which he would have exclaimed, “Alone I did it!”</p>

<p>But Colson was what, in spite of the writers of
fiction, is a useful personage in tracing
crime—Colson was a policeman, and he knew the value
of those often-derided police methods. He, for
example, could sit now, calmly smoking his pipe,
secure in the knowledge that every police station in
the district was on the look-out for Grayson, the
artist, that in a very short time Moss would probably
be found—also by police methods—and that a little
police machinery, which the superintendent was already
putting in hand as a result of their brief
conference after the inquest, would prevent Proctor
from slipping away from the neighbourhood
unobserved—if he had any such idea in his mind.</p>

<p>As Colson looked out of the window, half lost in
reflections, he noticed a man detach himself from
the little group that still lingered near the scene of
the tragedy, and go walking up the quay, hands in
pockets. It was Tom Gale, the “crew and cook”
of the schooner that was still moored at the quay
head, waiting for his cargo.</p>

<p>An idea struck the detective.</p>

<p>“That chap was about all the time,” he argued,
“it might be worth while having another chat with
him.”</p>

<p>So he went out, strolled along the quay, and
finally stepped aboard the schooner, where he found
Tom Gale in his favourite attitude of leaning over
the bulwarks.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, as he went up to him, “you gave
your evidence well to-day, my man. We like a
witness who speaks out plainly, and you did it.”</p>

<p>Tom grinned approval of the compliment. Inwardly
he was proud of being in any way mixed up
with the case. He knew he could tell the story—with
self-complimentary embellishments—for many
weeks in divers bars, and that many invitations to
“have one with me, mate,” would be the resulting
homage.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said, “I told ’em what I knew. I wish
it had been more, sir.”</p>

<p>“So do we all. But what you told us of Templeton
crossing the estuary—and seeing Moss—was
important, you know.”</p>

<p>Tom Gale made a mental note of how he could
truthfully say afterwards that if it hadn’t been for
him the police would have missed the very essence
of things—the detective himself had told him
so—and then spoke.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said, “I seen him plain enough. Just
over yonder ’twas,” and he jerked his thumb in the
direction of the opposite shore, “that ’ere little Jew
fellow, Moss, he stood on the shore, just there. D’ye
think ’twas him as did it, sir?” he asked with relish.</p>

<p>The detective shook his head mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said, “we mustn’t jump to conclusions
hastily, you know. So you saw him plainly, did
you?”</p>

<p>“Ah. T’other chap was only just a-askin’ on
me who lived in that house and I was tellin’ on him,
when there was Moss himself—I pointed ’im out.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘t’other chap’?” asked
the detective sharply.</p>

<p>“Why, him as was standin’ just where you might
be, sir, at the time—that young artist feller what was
lodging at the ‘Mariner’s Arms.’ ”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Colson, thoughtfully, “he was with
you, was he?”</p>

<p>“O’ course he was, sir—now, ought I to ha’ told
’em that at the inquest? I never thought of it.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the other. “It didn’t matter at
all. But, tell me. If this artist—Grayson is his
name—was with you, did he recognise Mr.
Templeton when he came back? Or speak to him?”</p>

<p>Tom Gale shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, sir; directly Mr. Templeton started coming
across, this here artist chap went straight back to
the inn—looked almost as if he didn’t want Mr.
Templeton to see him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did it?” said Colson. “Yes, I see.”</p>

<p>He filled his pipe and handed his pouch to the
other man. Tom Gale put his hand in his pocket,
ostensibly to get his pipe, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“ ’Ullo. I’d forgotten this,” and drew forth a
crumpled cigar.</p>

<p>He looked at it ruefully.</p>

<p>“Meant to ha’ smoked him yesterday, bein’
Sunday,” he said; “now he’s too far gone. I must
chop him up and smoke him in my pipe. ’Tain’t
often I gets hold of a cigar, guv’nor.”</p>

<p>Colson, who was looking at the cigar intently,
asked him quietly:</p>

<p>“Where did you get it from?”</p>

<p>“That ’ere artist feller we was just a-talkin’ about
gave ’im to me, sir, up yonder in the ‘Mariner’s
Arms.’ A good ’un, I reckon, ain’t he?”</p>

<p>The detective took the cigar in his hand and
smelt it. But, all the time, he was carefully
examining the band.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s good enough,” he said. “Pity you’ve
spoilt it. Oh—so Grayson gave it to you, did he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—Saturday afternoon, we was sittin’ in
the bar parlour, me and him, and he gave ’im to
me. He smoked two of ’em while I was there.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here,” said Colson, “have one of
mine instead, to make up for it.” And he pulled
out what he called his “diplomatic cigar case.” He
rarely smoked anything but a pipe himself, but he
always kept a few good cigars in his pocket. He
knew their value—when he was in search of
information.</p>

<p>“Take a couple,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Thankee, sir—don’t mind if I do.”</p>

<p>Tom Gale lighted one of them and smoked
complacently. The detective talked volubly and then
bid him good afternoon.</p>

<p>“Blowed if he ain’t took that cigar o’ mine with
him,” murmured Tom Gale after he had gone.
“Absent-minded like, I’ll ’low. It doan’t matter,
though.”</p>

<p>Colson, who had quietly slipped the crushed cigar
into his pocket, walked rapidly back to the inn.
Arrived in the bar parlour, he laid the cigar on the
table, took from his case the band which the Canon
had handed in at the inquest, and carefully
compared it with the other.</p>

<p>A smile lightened his face.</p>

<p>“That’s better!” he exclaimed. “Here’s something
to go upon at last. The same brand, that’s
what they are. It’s a good brand, but not specially
exclusive as that idiot of a parson wanted to make
out. Same brand as he smoked, he said. Very
likely, but the clergy ain’t got the monopoly of the
cigar trade. Anyhow, this looks convincing. This
young Grayson smoked these cigars, and someone
who was aboard the yacht smoked one of ’em there.
It’s good enough to go upon. Mrs. Yates!”</p>

<p>He opened the door as he spoke. The landlady
bustled in.</p>

<p>“I’m going back to Frattenbury now. And I
shan’t be staying the night here.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to lose you, Mr. Colson.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be helped, Mrs. Yates. I don’t think
there’s anything to keep me here for the present.
Oh—tell me. This young lodger of yours smoked
cigars, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He did, sir—as I knows. He was always dropping
the ash about—on my bedroom carpet too.”</p>

<p>“Do your carpets good, if you rub the ash in.”</p>

<p>“Lor’, sir! And the mess he made in the grate,
too.”</p>

<p>The detective looked at the grate sharply. On
the top of the coals, that were laid there ready to be
lighted, was a sprinkling of cigar ash and a couple
of red and gold bands. He picked them out.</p>

<p>“These came off his cigars, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“They must have, Mr. Colson. It’s few folks
ever smokes them things here. Pipes and ’baccy is
what they mostly uses.”</p>

<p>“Quite so. Well, I’ll run up and pack my bag
while you get my bill ready.”</p>

<p>He rode quickly into Frattenbury, in a very cheerful
mood, and reported to the superintendent. That
functionary was delighted.</p>

<p>“Good!” he exclaimed. “You’ve done well,
Colson. We must have this Grayson at any price.
Thompson has just been in to report that he stayed
at Selham on Sunday and Sunday night—at the
‘Wheatsheaf.’ ”</p>

<p>“Did he?” exclaimed Colson. “That makes matters
clearer than ever. He was on the spot on
Sunday night, eh?”</p>

<p>“He was seen riding into Frattenbury a couple
of hours ago,” went on the superintendent. “We’ll
soon have him. He can’t get away by train—we’ve
seen to that. By the way, Colson, the post has just
brought in a letter from the London police about
Moss. You’d better see it.”</p>

<p>He handed a typewritten paper to the detective,
who read:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Isaac Moss. In reference to your inquiries
  concerning this man, I beg to report as follows.
  He rents a small office at 13a, Hatton Garden.
  Deals in jewels, mostly diamonds, and is well
  known. Private residence, “Fairview,” No. 53,
  Compton Avenue, Brondesbury. Nothing known
  against him. Possesses passport, as he is
  frequently in Amsterdam. Boats being watched as
  precaution.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“I sent Tyler up yesterday,” went on the
superintendent. “He’s probably on his track by this
time.”</p>

<p>Late that night a message came through from
Tyler:</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p>Tracked our man, and have him under
  observation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Colson smoked the pipe of peace at his own fireside
that night. His wife listened attentively as
he told her all that he had done that day.</p>

<p>“Looks promising, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>She thought for a minute or two before she
replied:</p>

<p>“I hope so—for your sake. But there are still
difficulties. I want to know why the little bag with
the one diamond was put back in Mr. Templeton’s
waistcoat pocket—if the rest were stolen. And you
say yourself that the cigar band was not a <em>very</em>
extraordinary one. Be careful, dear, won’t you? I
want you to come out of this well, you know——”</p>

<p>Colson smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“All right, old girl,” he said, “I’ll be careful. I
know what you mean. We don’t want to get anyone
sent up for trial till we’re quite certain. It’s
too big a risk—and I’m not taking any risks in this
job.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X. <br> Harold Grayson is Detained</h2>

<p>Harold Grayson came down to breakfast on
the Tuesday morning in the little cottage where he
had found a lodging in the downland village of
Linderton, some four or five miles north of
Frattenbury, profoundly oblivious of the fact that the
stolid-looking policeman who was digging in his
garden directly opposite his lodgings had been,
according to orders, watching the house all night and
was yawning heavily at the prospect of the snooze
he would take when the promised relief came that
morning.</p>

<p>For although Harold Grayson had escaped detection
for the moment by riding round Frattenbury
instead of through it on his way to the downs,
the net which the superintendent had quietly spread
had soon closed in upon him. That stolid village
policeman, Constable Drake, to wit, already had a
description of the fugitive in his pocket, and when
Grayson had alighted from his bicycle the evening
before and asked him where he could get a bed,
Drake had recognised the quarry at once.</p>

<p>But Drake was absolutely imperturbable. By
never a sign did he intimate that anything unusual
was happening. Instead, he tilted back his helmet,
scratched his head thoughtfully—for he was really
thinking astutely all the time—and said:</p>

<p>“A bed, sir? Well, there’s the ‘Blue Lion,’ but
I’m not sure if you’d like it. It ain’t up to
much”—that was because the “Blue Lion” was at the
extreme end of the village, well away from the
constable’s cottage. “Let me see, now. Tell you what,
sir. We don’t often have anyone stayin’ here, but
there’s a neighbour o’ mine who lets rooms
sometimes—clean and comfortable they are. You come
along o’ me, sir, and I’ll do what I can for you.”</p>

<p>With a view to his own as well as the artist’s
comfort, he led him straightway to the cottage
opposite his own, and, with bland persuasion, induced
the occupant to take in the stranger. Grayson, as he
unstrapped his holdall from his bicycle, gratefully
gave him a tip, which the policeman as gratefully
acknowledged.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, sir,” he said, “Mrs. Goring ain’t
got much room for your bicycle. There’s my shed
handy. You can put it there if you like.”</p>

<p>Which Grayson promptly did, and as soon as he
had departed Drake promptly removed the valves—with
much satisfaction. Then he went indoors,
slowly and laboriously wrote a letter, which began,
“While on duty at 6.38 p.m. in the main road at
Linderton I was accosted,” and dispatched it by
his son, who took it into Frattenbury on his bicycle
and brought out a reply.</p>

<p>That is all that is necessary to say about
Police-Constable Drake. When he got his well-earned
snooze he had a vision of sergeant’s stripes in the
future.</p>

<p>As Grayson ate his eggs and bacon he could see
the line of downs opposite and was picturing in his
mind a pleasant day’s work, when a smart motor-car
drew up at the garden gate of the cottage and
a tall, military-looking man got out of it, followed
by a stiff-looking man in plain clothes, who took
up his position outside the cottage. A moment
later the landlady opened the door of the room
and announced:</p>

<p>“A gentleman to see you, sir.”</p>

<p>Grayson rose, surprised.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” exclaimed the newcomer.
“Your name is Grayson, I believe—Mr. Harold
Grayson?”</p>

<p>“It is,” replied Grayson; “but I confess I haven’t
the honour——”</p>

<p>“I am Major Renshaw, Chief Constable of this
district. I fear I have rather an unpleasant duty
to perform.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“You were recently staying at the ‘Mariner’s
Arms’ at Marsh Quay, I believe?”</p>

<p>Grayson, looking a little uncomfortable under the
penetrating gaze of Major Renshaw, replied that he
was.</p>

<p>“And you left rather suddenly, very early on
Sunday morning?”</p>

<p>“I did—but I don’t understand——”</p>

<p>“It was a little unfortunate, Mr. Grayson, that
you did so. Please understand that I am making
no charge against you at present, but I suppose
you are aware what took place at Marsh Quay the
night before you left?”</p>

<p>The young man shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, come now!” said Major Renshaw sharply.
“Mr. Templeton’s murder—you must have heard
of it. Everyone’s talking about it, and you’ve been
in the neighbourhood all the time.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Templeton’s murder?” stammered Grayson.
“He—he had his yacht there.”</p>

<p>“I see you know <em>that</em>,” said the Chief Constable
grimly. “And do you mean to tell me you don’t
know that he was murdered on that yacht?”</p>

<p>“I—I—really I don’t.”</p>

<p>Major Renshaw shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you can explain,” he said coldly. “You
must be an extraordinary young man either to think
you can make me believe you know nothing or to
have escaped hearing about it. Perhaps you won’t
mind telling me your movements since you left
Marsh Quay?”</p>

<p>“I—I can do that. You may not believe me,
and I admit it sounds strange—but I’ll tell you the
facts. I left the ‘Mariner’s Arms’ quite early,
intending to go to Frattenbury. Then I changed my
mind and went to Selham. I put up at the ‘Wheatsheaf’
there. I asked them to give me some lunch
to take out with me—I wanted to do some sketching—I
am fond of being alone—I suffered from
shell-shock in the war—and I find it rests me.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said the Major, a little more sympathetically
now that Grayson had touched on his erstwhile
profession. “What did you do next?”</p>

<p>“I found my way to a very lonely bit of the
coast and sketched. I can show you the sketches.
I particularly wanted to get a sunset effect, so I
waited till then. When I started back I began to
feel hungry, and called at a solitary farm-house,
where they gave me bread and cheese and milk.
It was dark when I left and I wandered considerably
out of my way before I got back to the ‘Wheatsheaf.’
When I did, I was awfully tired. I glanced
in the tap-room. There was a noisy crowd there,
so I went straight to bed. I never spoke to anyone.”</p>

<p>“Go on, please. The next morning?”</p>

<p>“I was up early. There was only a girl about,
and she got me some breakfast. Then I paid my bill
and rode off.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“To the lower part of the estuary. I bought some
food at a grocer’s shop in a village I passed through,
sketched till the afternoon, and then rode out here.
With the exception of the girl in the morning and
a deaf old woman in the grocer’s shop, I never
spoke to a soul all day till I asked the village
policeman here where I could get a bed. Those are the
facts, Major Renshaw. I hope you don’t dispute
them?”</p>

<p>The Chief Constable regarded him critically, but
did not answer his question. Instead he asked:</p>

<p>“Did you know this Mr. Reginald Templeton?”</p>

<p>The young man hesitated a little.</p>

<p>“Yes—I did,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“Did you see him to speak to at Marsh Quay?”</p>

<p>“N—no.”</p>

<p>“You knew he was there—you have admitted
that already.”</p>

<p>“Yes—I knew he was there.”</p>

<p>“You avoided him, then?”</p>

<p>Grayson nodded.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well—you see—we weren’t exactly friends.
That’s why I came away. I didn’t want to meet
him.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>After a brief silence the Chief Constable said:</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Grayson, I told you mine was an
unpleasant duty. I make no charge against you at
present, but there are certain ugly facts which you
will have to account for. You are not under
arrest—or I should not, of course, have questioned
you—but I am afraid I shall have to ask you to come
back with me to Frattenbury and I must warn you
that you will be detained there, at all events till
you can give a further account of yourself. I am
sorry if there is any mistake. I cannot say more.”</p>

<p>Grayson bowed. He was still very pale and a little
agitated. He recognised the seriousness of his
position.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he said quietly, “and of course
I cannot refuse to go with you; but I assure you
it is all a mistake.”</p>

<p>“I hope it is,” said Major Renshaw dryly. “You
had better bring some things with you—for your
own comfort.”</p>

<p>Just before they were ready to start the Chief
Constable suddenly said:</p>

<p>“Have you any cigars on you, Mr. Grayson?”</p>

<p>The young man pulled out his case.</p>

<p>“These are all I have left. Why?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Major Renshaw, putting the
case in his pocket. “I’m afraid I must deprive you
of them.”</p>

<p>“Am I not allowed to smoke?” asked Grayson.
“I understood I was not under arrest.”</p>

<p>Major Renshaw smiled grimly, and as soon as
they were in the car offered his cigarette-case.</p>

<p>“Smoke, by all means,” he said. “I’ll supply you
willingly. Only we rather bar cigars.”</p>

<p>He looked at him keenly as he spoke. But
Grayson was lighting a cigarette quite calmly.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the police station a further
examination took place in the presence of the
superintendent and Colson. Grayson, who had recovered
his equanimity by this time, repeated all he had
told the Chief Constable. The superintendent took
careful notes.</p>

<p>“We shall make inquiries, Mr. Grayson,” he said,
“to verify these statements so far as the people
to whom you say you spoke are concerned. Now
will you tell me, please, something about yourself?”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“Well, your home.”</p>

<p>“I am at present in lodgings in London. I will
give you the address. My home is just outside
Marlow, in Buckinghamshire. My father, who is a
county magistrate, is well known—Mr. Osmond
Grayson.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing in this neighbourhood?”</p>

<p>“Sketching, mostly.”</p>

<p>“Did you know that Mr. Templeton was likely
to be at Marsh Quay?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. I have already told you I wished
to avoid him when I found he was there.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because—well, the whole affair is a private
matter.”</p>

<p>“You need not tell us unless you wish to, Mr.
Grayson,” interposed the Chief Constable. “But if
the rest of your story is correct it will materially
help us to account for your hasty departure.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the young man after a moment’s
thought, “there is really nothing to conceal. Some
years ago my father was involved in a lawsuit with
Mr. Templeton—and won it. Templeton had to sell
his estate to pay the costs, and my father bought
it. He hated the lot of us, and, I think, justly,
because it’s always been my opinion that my father
was not so much in the right as the law said he
was. My father knows I think this. Well, if you
want the truth, when I knew that Templeton was
at Marsh Quay I didn’t want him to see me, because
I’m a bit ashamed of the whole affair. I watched to
see him come off the yacht to make quite sure it
was he, and when I saw it was, I made up my mind
to leave early the next morning. That’s all there
is in it.”</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to know the name of Mr.
Templeton’s solicitors when this case was tried, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. Of course I remember. Sir Henry
Cateford was his counsel—I forget the name of the
junior—and his solicitors were Crosby and Paxton,
well-known people, I believe.”</p>

<p>The Chief Constable and the superintendent exchanged
glances, but Colson broke in at that moment.
“Do you recognise this cigar?” he asked, showing
him the crushed one he had received from Tom
Gale.</p>

<p>Grayson examined it.</p>

<p>“It’s the same brand I’ve been smoking lately,” he
said. “I couldn’t swear, of course, that it’s one of
my actual cigars. What of it? If I can explain
anything I’m quite willing to do so.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell us if you smoked one of your cigars
on board Mr. Templeton’s yacht, then?” asked
Colson.</p>

<p>“I never was on his yacht. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>The detective did not reply to this. He asked
another question:</p>

<p>“Can you account for your movements from ten
o’clock on Saturday night to, say, six o’clock on
the following morning?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t,” replied Grayson.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I happened to be asleep. I went to bed
at the ‘Mariner’s Arms’ just before ten, and I woke
up at a quarter-past six. I can’t help you there.”</p>

<p>“It was to help you that the question was asked,”
said the superintendent gravely.</p>

<p>The young man gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>“I see what you mean,” he said, “but the same
thing applies to a score or so of people who were
sleeping close to the quay that night, doesn’t it? I
can’t prove an alibi any more than they can.”</p>

<p>The Chief Constable shrugged his shoulders, but
would not commit himself.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Grayson,” he said, “thank you for
all you have told us. I’m sorry we must detain
you for a time, but I hope, for your sake, it will not
be long. Superintendent Norton will do his best to
make you comfortable. We shan’t lock you up in a
cell, you know—unless we see cause to arrest you.
But you won’t be allowed to leave the house.”</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked when Grayson was out of the
room.</p>

<p>“I’m not satisfied yet,” said Colson. “There’s that
matter of the cigar band. I’d like to have it
identified by Canon Fittleworth. I don’t expect it, but
he <em>may</em> help us there.”</p>

<p>The superintendent laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too down on the parson, Colson,” he
said. “We’ll see what he says by and by. Meanwhile,
Mr. Crosby ought to be here. He can identify
Grayson’s statement about the lawsuit, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Chief Constable, “I agree.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Crosby came in, by appointment,
and was told of the detention of Grayson
and the statement he had made.</p>

<p>“I can verify all he says about there being ill-feeling
between my late client and Grayson’s family,”
he said. “That’s perfectly true. I don’t know
this young Grayson personally, but from what I’ve
heard of him he’s all right. He did splendidly in
the war, I know—and he’s had to pay for
it—yes—shell-shock, Major. That’s all right. As to what
you tell me about the cigar band, you’ll get Canon
Fittleworth to identify it, I suppose? Exactly. As
it’s a fairly well-known brand, I shouldn’t think
there’s much upon which to build a case; but that’s
your lookout. Whoever the fellow is, I hope you’ll
get him. Now, I’m returning to London immediately
after the funeral. I shall come down to the
adjourned inquest, of course. But is there anything
else I ought to know?”</p>

<p>“We’re in confidence, Mr. Crosby?” asked the
wary superintendent.</p>

<p>“Of course. As the legal representative of the
deceased I shall naturally observe that.”</p>

<p>“We’d like to show you a few things we found
in the cabin, then. Colson, where are they?”</p>

<p>Colson, who had stipulated that at this juncture
no mention should be made of the walking-stick—he
was emphatic on this point—produced the chamois
leather bag, the diamond and the blotting-pad.
From the latter he had transcribed the scraps of
writing, in print capitals, onto a piece of ordinary
paper.</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at the exhibits shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Wonder what he was doing with diamonds,” he
said. “Of course there were more than this one.
And the bag was not tied up, you say?
H’m—queer! Yes—I see—the first letter you’ve put
together very well. Evidently his appointment with
Moss. You’ve got your eye on him, eh?”</p>

<p>“One of us will probably run up to interview him
to-morrow,” said the superintendent. “He’s under
observation.”</p>

<p>“Of course—good. And this other bit of 
writing—— Gad! it’s a poser, isn’t it? Have you made
it out?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Colson.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a copy. I’m rather keen on this sort
of thing. I’ll see what I can make of it. Of course,
as you say, it might be of importance—if in any
way it put you on the track of the individual with
whom Templeton had an appointment on Saturday
night.” He copied it carefully. “You’ve allowed for
the blank spaces in the original?” he asked Colson.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The lawyer studied the letters for a minute.</p>

<blockquote class="blotter">

  <p> a d  ver  zr    ice s  o     ion &amp;  roo </p>
  <p>   s is   nal</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“There’s one point about it that strikes one,” he
said. “I dare say you’ve noticed it, sergeant. There
aren’t many words that have the letters ZR close
together. The only one I can think of is ‘Ezra,’
eh?”</p>

<p>“I thought of that, too, sir.”</p>

<p>The superintendent was looking over the lawyer’s
shoulder. He laughed.</p>

<p>“Ezra’s ices!” he exclaimed. “Sounds like an
Italian Jew and an ice-cream barrow!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI. <br> The Canon’s Cigars</h2>

<p>One can only suppose that the morbid curiosity
which always attracts a crowd of people to the
burial of a suicide or victim of a murder repays the
onlookers in some sense or other. It is difficult to
say how it does so. The utmost they see or hear
is a glimpse of an ordinary coffin and the words
of the Burial Service.</p>

<p>It was a large crowd that gathered on the Tuesday
afternoon to witness the funeral of Reginald
Templeton, which took place in the cemetery a mile out
of Frattenbury. There were few mourners. The
Canon’s brother, a retired colonel, had run down
for the occasion and occupied the leading mourning
coach with the Canon himself and Winnie Cotterill.
Crosby and the doctor who had attended the case
came in the other.</p>

<p>On the return journey to the city, Winnie Cotterill,
who was seated next to the Canon, remarked:</p>

<p>“It’s a curious thing, Canon Fittleworth, but several
times I’ve had the impression that Frattenbury
is familiar to me.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the girl. “It’s just come over me now.
That view of the Cathedral spire—and the little
stream of water we’ve just crossed—it’s just as if
I’ve seen them before.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you have,” said the Canon.</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I can,” she replied; “I’ve never
been here before, so far as I know.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” said the Canon, with a little
pride, “our Cathedral is pretty well known, and I
dare say you’ve seen pictures or photographs of it.
That might account for it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” replied Winnie slowly, “but it doesn’t
seem to—it’s that funny sort of feeling that I’ve
been here, don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Canon Fittleworth, “it’s a
psychological curiosity. I’ve had it myself often.
‘There are more things in heaven and earth—’
eh, Charles?”</p>

<p>“True. Possibly,” he went on to the girl, “you’ve
heard people describing Frattenbury.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ll think me very ignorant,” she
said, “but I don’t think I ever heard of Frattenbury
till I read about the murder in the paper yesterday
morning. I’ve never even been in the South of
England.”</p>

<p>“We’re not so famous as we thought we were,
Miss Cotterill,” said the Canon with a smile. “What
do you think of our War Memorial?”</p>

<p>They were passing through a little square just at
the entry of the city, in the centre of which stood
one of those, now familiar, erections which are to
remind people that the Great European War was
characterised by many atrocities.</p>

<p>She looked at it, shrugged her shoulders—it may
have been the expression of an opinion—and then,
closing her eyes, said slowly:</p>

<p>“It looks as if there ought to be a big lamp-post
there, instead.”</p>

<p>“There was,” replied the Canon dryly. “I don’t
know that I didn’t prefer it. Really, Miss Cotterill,
you must have considerable psychic powers.”</p>

<p>“I never knew it till now.”</p>

<p>A minute or two later they entered the Cathedral
precincts, and drew up at the Canon’s residence. As
they got out Mr. Norwood happened to be passing.
He raised his hat and bowed in his stiff, formal
manner. Winnie Cotterill looked at him intently.</p>

<p>“Who was that?” she asked the Canon as they
went into the house.</p>

<p>“One of our Frattenbury solicitors—a Mr.
Norwood,” replied the Canon.</p>

<p>“It’s that queer sensation again,” remarked the
girl. “When he took his hat off it seemed to me
exactly as if I’d seen him before—only that he’s
older or something.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s quite possible. Although he’s lived
all his life in Frattenbury he’s often in London.
One really meets—quite casually—many people who
leave an impression on one.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s that,” said Winnie. “It must
be—of course.”</p>

<p>“Is his name familiar to you?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. I never heard it before.”</p>

<p>There were several letters for the Canon lying
on the hall table. He took them up, saying as he
did so:</p>

<p>“Tea ought to be ready. I expect you’ll find Mrs.
Fittleworth in the drawing-room. Do you mind
telling her I’ll be there in a minute?”</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>“Canon Fittleworth?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you <em>can</em> find out whether the police have
done anything—about Mr. Grayson—before I go,
I should be so grateful.”</p>

<p>“I will,” he said. “I’ll go round to the police
station immediately after tea.”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully good of you.”</p>

<p>He nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” he said.</p>

<p>Then, as she went into the drawing-room, he
opened his letters. His face looked grave as he read
one of them, a note from the police superintendent.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p class="salutation">Dear Sir,</p>

  <p>We have detained, on suspicion, the young
  artist, named Grayson, who was staying at the
  “Mariner’s Arms” at Marsh Quay. I shall be
  grateful if you can kindly make it convenient
  to call here any time between five and six this
  afternoon. We want you to corroborate a small
  matter. I called this morning, but you were out,
  and I was told you would not be disengaged till
  after the funeral. Will you kindly bring with
  you one of your cigars similar to that which you
  say contained the band found by you at Marsh
  Quay?</p>

  <p class="valediction">Yours faithfully,</p>
  <p class="signature">Thomas Norton.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>He thought for a moment, and then went into his
study and rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Tell your mistress I want to see her for a minute,”
he told the maid.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he said to his wife when she came
in, “the police have written to tell me they have
that young man, Grayson, detained at the police
station. I had only just promised Miss Cotterill
to go round after tea and make inquiries, before she
leaves. I shall have to go in any case. They’ve
asked me.”</p>

<p>“Poor child,” said Mrs. Fittleworth, “she seems
very much concerned about Mr. Grayson. I think
she’s fond of him, Charles. I <em>hope</em> he isn’t the
murderer.”</p>

<p>The Canon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“That’s not for us to judge,” he said, “nor must
we jump at hasty conclusions. If there’s nothing
against him, however, I should like to be able to tell
Miss Cotterill before she goes.” He looked at his
watch. “Her train leaves in less than an hour—and
they may keep me at the police station longer than
I thought.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fittleworth, out of the kindness of her heart,
rose to the occasion.</p>

<p>“She shall stay another night. I’ll persuade her.
I like the girl very much, Charles. You see, if
there’s nothing really against the young man we
ought to know in the morning. And if there <em>is</em>, well,
perhaps I can comfort her a little.”</p>

<p>The Canon beamed his satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I quite agree,” he said. “Don’t tell her just now
that the police have detained him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t <em>you</em> let it out, dear!” she replied. “Give
me five minutes to persuade her to stay, and then
come in to tea.”</p>

<p>Left to himself, Canon Fittleworth opened his
cigar cupboard and took out a box. He was about
to place one of the three or four remaining cigars
in his case, when he stopped.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he murmured, “I’ll take the box itself
round. I ought to have thought of that before. It
may be useful!”</p>

<p>After tea he went round to the police station and
was shown into the superintendent’s private office,
where he found, with that functionary, Major
Renshaw and Colson.</p>

<p>“Sorry to give you the trouble, Canon,” said
Major Renshaw, “but we’ve detained this young
man on suspicion, and you may help us. So far,
I’m bound to admit, he’s given a straightforward
account of himself. His story sounded a little thin
at first, but we’ve corroborated it as far as we were
able. Only, there’s one point that is dead against
him. And that’s where <em>you</em> come in.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked the Canon.</p>

<p>The Chief Constable nodded to Colson to go on.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the detective, “you produced,
at the inquest, yesterday, a cigar band which you
stated you found in Mr. Templeton’s cabin.”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“You would recognise it again?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly. I said, you remember, that it
was the same brand as my own cigars.”</p>

<p>The detective smiled pityingly.</p>

<p>“That may be,” he said with a touch of sarcasm
in his voice; “at all events we want you to tell us
now—is this the band?”</p>

<p>And he took from his pocket-case the band which
had figured at the inquest. The Canon took a quick
glance at it.</p>

<p>“No. Certainly not!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The three men looked at him in surprise. Colson
ejaculated:</p>

<p>“Great Scott!”</p>

<p>Then he said:</p>

<p>“Come, sir—it <em>must</em> be.”</p>

<p>“I tell you it isn’t. It’s entirely different. The
band I found in the cabin, and handed in yesterday
afternoon, was similar to these.”</p>

<p>And he opened his own cigar box.</p>

<p>“But <em>this</em> is the band you handed in yesterday,
sir,” exclaimed Colson, pointing to the one he had
just produced.</p>

<p>“It is nothing of the kind,” said the Canon a little
hotly. “I am ready to swear to that.”</p>

<p>There was a moment or two of intense silence,
and then the superintendent said to Colson:</p>

<p>“Are you <em>sure</em> this is the band you received from
the inquest?”</p>

<p>Colson, who, like the Canon, did not relish his
integrity being shaken, replied stiffly:</p>

<p>“Quite sure, sir. I saw the Canon lay it on the
table, an——”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t examine it closely then,” broke
in the Canon.</p>

<p>“No—but I watched it being passed from man
to man of the jury, and when it was finally put
down on the table I didn’t remove my eyes from
it till it was in my hands.”</p>

<p>The superintendent slowly nodded his head.</p>

<p>“You are quite certain, Canon?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“Absolutely. This is <em>not</em> the band I laid on the
table.”</p>

<p>Colson gave a low whistle and then pursed up
his lips.</p>

<p>“There <em>may</em> be an explanation,” he said, “and a
very significant one, too. But it is most important
that these facts do not get about. May we rely on
your discretion, Canon Fittleworth?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly. Of course I shall say nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well—the point is this, Canon Fittleworth. Now
that you know so much I may as well tell you.
This young Grayson was smoking a brand of cigars
similar to that off which this particular band, which
you repudiate, came. You will admit it was damning
evidence against him.”</p>

<p>“It certainly was,” said the Canon. “I am only
too glad to have helped to clear an innocent man.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Chief Constable thoughtfully, “I
suppose—I suppose this clears him—but——”</p>

<p>Colson, who had sprung to his feet suddenly,
interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” he exclaimed, “I’ll make still more
certain. Can I borrow your motor-bike sir?” he
asked the superintendent. “I’ll be back in twenty
minutes—or less.”</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded.</p>

<p>“All right, Colson.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait till he comes back,” said the Canon.
“I am anxious, for certain reasons, to see this young
man set at liberty before I go home.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re staying,” said the superintendent,
who was examining one of the Canon’s cigars. “I
want to have a talk with you about this. I see
what you mean. This is a brand I don’t know at
all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you do,” replied the Canon.
“They are not on the market. A Spanish friend
of mine sent them me direct from Cuba. They’re
something very special.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say this at the inquest, sir?”</p>

<p>The Canon hesitated.</p>

<p>“Well—er—I really was so very much taken
aback at Norwood’s manner—I am not accustomed
to be spoken to like that—in public. And it made
me forget what I should otherwise have said.”</p>

<p>Again the superintendent addressed him in
sorrowful rebuke:</p>

<p>“Oh, Canon Fittleworth! You really <em>ought</em> to
have told the jury—or even if you forgot it at that
moment, you <em>might</em> have told us. See the trouble
to which you have put us.”</p>

<p>The worthy Canon bristled a little.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come to me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well—sir—when we saw what sort of a brand
it was, fairly ordinary, we didn’t think it worth
while.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the Canon, a twinkle in his eye now,
“see the trouble you have given yourselves! If you’d
only remembered that I <em>said</em> it was a particular
brand!”</p>

<p>“Come, Canon,” interposed the Chief Constable
with a laugh, “we mustn’t get acrimonious about it.
It’s a little mistake on both sides. But now what
you’ve got to do is to try to remember if anyone
else but yourself smoked cigars taken from that
box.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the Canon, “I can remember
at the moment someone who took a cigar out of my
box.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?” asked the Chief Constable eagerly.</p>

<p>“You yourself, Renshaw—last time you dined with
me. And you remarked what an excellent smoke
it was.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha,” laughed the Chief Constable. “You
want to fix the murder on <em>me</em>, eh?”</p>

<p>The Canon joined in the laugh.</p>

<p>“Circumstantial evidence, eh?” he said.</p>

<p>“But, seriously, Canon,” went on Major Renshaw,
“I don’t expect you to do it now, but I do ask you
to shut yourself up in your study and make a big
effort of memory. It’s wonderful how one can recall
little details if one really tries. Write out the names
of everyone—<em>everyone</em> mind—even the most unlikely
persons—to whom you remember you offered
a cigar out of that box. And if you can call to mind
anybody who took away a cigar out of your house
without smoking it, that will be <em>most</em> important.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied the Canon, “I’ll do what
you suggest. My circle of friends is a fairly
respectable one, however, and I hope I don’t number a
murderer among them.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Colson had rushed over to Marsh
Quay. It was not yet six o’clock, so the inn was
not open. He knocked at the door and Mrs. Yates
let him in. Satisfying himself that there was no one
else about, he said to her:</p>

<p>“As I told you before, Mrs. Yates, I look upon
you as an exceedingly discreet woman. Now, I
want you to keep your mouth shut about what I’m
going to ask you.”</p>

<p>“I will, Mr. Colson.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a good memory, eh?”</p>

<p>“I hope so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, try and remember now. This young man
who was lodging with you, what did his luggage
consist of?”</p>

<p>“It was placed in a holdall he carried on the back
of his bicycle. There was a satchel in front, and
one of them folding things what they put their
pictures on when they paints them.”</p>

<p>“An easel?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Anything else—an umbrella?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Or a walking-stick?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure? I want you to be very
careful.”</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure, Mr. Colson, and I’ll tell you
for why. First of all, I helped him undo his luggage
when he arrived, and secondly, he borrowed this
here stick—what used to belong to my late
husband—several times when he went out walkin’. I
can swear to that.”</p>

<p>The detective glanced at a brown polished
walking-stick with a knob at the end.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “That’s all I want to know.
And I’ll give you a bit of information in return.
It’s pretty certain <em>he</em> isn’t the man we want.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear that, Mr. Colson. I liked the
young feller.”</p>

<p>The detective had turned to go, but paused a
minute.</p>

<p>“It would be better for him still, Mrs. Yates,
if you could prove that he was really in your house
all night.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir—I’m sure he was here till past one in
the morning.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“He went to bed just before ten, sir. I had a
toothache that night which kept me awake till just
after one. And the way that young man snored was
enough to keep anyone awake—let alone the
toothache.”</p>

<p>The detective laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then.”</p>

<p>“We’ve eliminated one of the three,” he said to
himself as he rode back. “And that’s not a bad
bit o’ work, anyhow.”</p>

<p>When he arrived at the police station the Canon
was still there. The detective whispered a few words
to the superintendent and Major Renshaw, and the
latter said:</p>

<p>“You’ll be glad to know, Canon, that we needn’t
detain this young man any longer. Would you like
to see him before you go?”</p>

<p>“I should, very much.”</p>

<p>When Grayson came in, Major Renshaw shook
hands with him.</p>

<p>“We’re quite satisfied about you, Mr. Grayson,
and I must apologise for detaining you. But a
stranger who goes off suddenly and mysteriously
from the scene of a murder must expect to rouse
suspicions—and you certainly did. Let me
introduce you to my friend, Canon Fittleworth. You
really owe your freedom this evening to him—though
he won’t tell you why, because he mustn’t.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m most grateful to you, sir,” said the
young artist to the Canon.</p>

<p>“Delighted,” replied the latter. “I’m so glad to
have been of any use in getting you out of an
awkward predicament.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Grayson,” went on the Chief Constable,
“we brought you in from Linderton this morning
against your will. Will you allow me to send
you back in my motor?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Grayson, “I think I’ll get a bed
in Frattenbury. My holiday was nearly up, and I
shall return to town to-morrow. I can walk out in
the morning and get my machine and the rest of
my belongings.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t,” said Major Renshaw, anxious to
make amends. “I’ll have them sent in—yes, you’ll
be comfortable at the ‘Dolphin’—they shall be there
early to-morrow morning. Good night—stop—let
me have your address in case we want you.”</p>

<p>The Canon, leaving his cigar box with the police,
walked out of the station with Grayson and directed
him to the hotel. Then he said:</p>

<p>“As the nearest relative of poor Templeton—I’m
his cousin, you know—I should like to offer you a
slight return for all the trouble you’ve gone through
to-day. Will you give us the pleasure of dining with
us to-night—at half-past seven?”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully kind of you, sir—but I haven’t any
dress clothes with me.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter in the least. You will?
That’s right, then. Good-bye for the present.”</p>

<p>And the Canon chuckled as he went his way home.
And his wife agreed he had done the right thing.
When the Canon took the young artist into the
drawing-room, just before dinner that night, Winnie
Cotterill looked up with a start—and Grayson’s eyes
sparkled.</p>

<p>“Winnie!” he exclaimed, “I didn’t expect to meet
<em>you</em> here. This is a pleasant surprise.”</p>

<p>“Miss Cotterill has been anxious to know about
you,” said Mrs. Fittleworth. “She heard you were
in danger of arrest.”</p>

<p>“So I brought you round to show her that you’re
really free,” said the Canon, rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>“I’m most awfully glad to see—you’ve escaped
from the police,” said Winnie. “I <em>knew</em> you couldn’t
have done the murder.”</p>

<p>“Come along,” said the Canon. “Mr. Grayson,
will you take my wife in to dinner, please?” and he
offered his own arm to Winnie Cotterill.</p>

<p>“You’re a perfect dear, Canon Fittleworth,” said
the girl as they crossed the hall. “How clever you
must have been to get him off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>I</em> didn’t get him off, as you call it, Miss
Cotterill. I helped to explain something, that’s all.
Now you won’t worry any more.”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you need!” said the Canon dryly,
a twinkle in his eye as he spoke.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII. <br> Fresh Evidence</h2>

<p>The three police officials, after the departure of
the Canon and Grayson, looked thoughtfully at each
other for a few moments. The Chief Constable said:</p>

<p>“Well—there’s an end of young Grayson, as far
as we are concerned.”</p>

<p>Colson was heard to mutter something beneath his
breath that sounded like “blighted parson.” Then
the Chief Constable went on:</p>

<p>“I’ve asked Canon Fittleworth, Colson, to try to
remember anyone who had any of his cigars.”</p>

<p>Colson nodded. He took one of the Canon’s cigars
out of the box, looked at it, put it in his case, and
carefully examined the label on the outside of the
box.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked the superintendent.</p>

<p>“I don’t altogether depend on the Canon, sir.
Other people might get hold of these cigars as well—if
they’ve friends in Cuba, or are in the trade. Of
course I agree with you, sir,” he went on to Major
Renshaw, “and we must take note of anyone who
had a cigar from the Canon. But it isn’t <em>there</em> I
fancy that we shall find our man. May I venture
to give an opinion?”</p>

<p>“Do,” said the others.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s fairly obvious that the original cigar
band was changed while passing round the jury.
I’ve got my suspicions—but I won’t say just now.”</p>

<p>“Ought we to tell the coroner, and get the jury—or
any suspected person on it—dismissed?” asked
Major Renshaw.</p>

<p>“By no means, sir. That’s what I was just coming
to. The man who changed that band should be the
same as the individual who went after the walking-stick.
We don’t want to rouse his suspicions at this
stage. Let him think the band has gone the same
way as the stick—that we’ve lost both clues.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked the superintendent.</p>

<p>“By making it public, just so far as we choose,
and no farther. The blight—the Canon’s bungled it
up till now. If he’d only given us that band, instead
of producing it at the inquest, we could have kept
it dark. As it is, every newspaper’s got a head-line
with ‘The Cigar Band Clue—What are the Police
doing?’ and all that rot. Well, let’s keep it up. Let
the public think we’ve tested the clue and that we’re
satisfied there’s nothing in it.”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot in what he says,” remarked the
superintendent to the Chief Constable, who nodded
agreement.</p>

<p>“Let the newspaper fellows know this—give ’em
an ‘official statement.’ They love that. And if you,
sir,” to Major Renshaw, “could mention it, casual
like, it would help.”</p>

<p>“I’m dining out at Mr. Norwood’s to-night,” said
the Chief Constable—“one of what he calls his
bachelor dinners. Dr. Hazell is sure to be there. He’s
the biggest gossip in the place. It will be all over
Frattenbury to-morrow if I mention it—ha,
ha—‘on the authority of the Chief Constable.’ ”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I want, sir,” said the detective
eagerly. “It’ll give more weight locally than
all the newspapers. And I’ve got a sort of inspiration
that we haven’t to go out of the district to find
our man.”</p>

<p>“Unless, after all, it should happen to be Moss?”
said the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>“He’s not really out of the district—and we’ll see
him to-morrow,” replied Colson.</p>

<p>“If there’s nothing to keep us here, we’re both
going up to London to-morrow morning,” explained
the superintendent. “Oh, and by the way, sir, all
known dealers in rough stones have been warned—and
there’s an eye being kept on certain fences.
Not that it’s likely that the murderer—if he’s got
the stones—would sell them just now.”</p>

<p>“And it’s probable that they’re not far off,” said
Colson dryly.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Chief Constable, rising from his
seat, “I’m off. I must dress for dinner. If you
want me, Superintendent, ring up Norwood, he’s on
the phone. I shall be there till about eleven.”</p>

<p>The little dinners which Francis Norwood gave
periodically were as stiff and formal as Francis
Norwood himself. But they were always good, and
his port was of excellent vintage. There were four
guests that night—all of the male sex. The coroner
rarely invited ladies, and then only the wives of his
intimate friends. He sat, stiff and erect, at the
head of the table, on his right Major Renshaw and
Sir Peter Birchnall, a local magnate and magistrate,
on his left a clean-shaven, round-faced man of short
but rather portly dimensions, who was the Dr. Hazell
referred to by the Chief Constable, and a
comfortable-looking clergyman, the Reverend Alfred
Carringford, the vicar of the parish in which the
coroner resided.</p>

<p>The maid—Norwood had no men-servants—had
just put on the dessert with its accompaniments of
wine and a box of cigars. Norwood passed round
the port, and helped himself when it reached him
again.</p>

<p>Sir Peter held his glass up to the light, took a
sip, and smiled approvingly.</p>

<p>“ ’72, if ’m not mistaken, Norwood?”</p>

<p>Norwood nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “I’m sorry to say I’ve only a few
more bottles left. And it’s too heavy a price to-day,
even if there’s any on the market.”</p>

<p>Dr. Hazell raised his eyebrows and shook his
head knowingly. Norwood was reputed to be a
wealthy man, and the little doctor was sceptical.</p>

<p>“If you want to replenish your cellar, I can put
you on to a good thing, Norwood,” went on Sir
Peter.</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“Buy ‘Virginian Reefs.’ They’re bound to go up.
I happen to have seen the engineer’s latest report.
It’s a safe thing.”</p>

<p>“ ‘Virginian Reefs,’ eh?” said Dr. Hazell, taking
out his notebook. “You recommend them, do you,
Sir Peter?”</p>

<p>“I hold some myself,” replied the Baronet
pompously, and with the air of one who could not be
wrong.</p>

<p>Norwood shook his head and smiled his dry little
smile.</p>

<p>“We lawyers are not over-keen on speculation,”
he said. “ ‘Virginian Reefs’—yes. I imagined they
were in low water.”</p>

<p>“Seven and sixpence was yesterday’s price, but
they’ll go to three and four pounds. The general
public know nothing yet, of course. This is the
chance for picking them up.”</p>

<p>Norwood, who was peeling an apple, at this point
sent round the cigars. Carringford remarked as he
lighted one:</p>

<p>“That was a strange circumstance—the discovery
of that cigar band by Fittleworth in that Marsh
Quay case.”</p>

<p>He looked at Norwood as he spoke. The coroner
replied stiffly:</p>

<p>“You can’t expect me to discuss that, Vicar.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” said the doctor, “but it was a
queer thing, as you say, Carringford. I suppose,
Major,” and he leaned his elbows on the table and
looked across at the Chief Constable, “I suppose the
whole thing is keeping you pretty busy?”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” replied Major Renshaw, cutting and
lighting his cigar.</p>

<p>“Now here,” and the doctor held up the band he
had just removed from his own cigar, “here is an
innocent enough looking thing, and yet it might
hang a man in this case, easily enough. You policemen
have to note the merest trifles—well, just as we
doctors do sometimes. A tiny symptom, Major—the
flutter of an eyelid, a pain in the little finger, so to
speak—but we know it points to a fatal disease.
And I suppose you attach the greatest importance
to this bit of red paper. It’s <em>the</em> clue, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now,” said Sir Peter, “you’re asking
leading questions of the police. It won’t do,
Doctor.”</p>

<p>Major Renshaw removed the cigar from his mouth,
puffed a volume of smoke across the table, and said:
“Oh, I don’t know. As a matter of fact, I don’t
mind saying that we attach very little importance
to that cigar band.”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked the coroner, sipping his port.
“I confess I shouldn’t have thought that—though
I don’t wish of course, to give an opinion.”</p>

<p>“No,” went on the Chief Constable, “I don’t think
there’s much in it. And, as a matter of fact, we’ve
tested it already. The brand was more common
than Canon Fittleworth led us to suppose, and, after
all, very likely had nothing to do with the murder
at all. It might have been in the cabin for days.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said the doctor, who was listening
intently. “That’s rather a disappointment to you,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The Major shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“It’s not much use following up such a very
doubtful clue,” he admitted.</p>

<p>Norwood apparently did not care for the subject
of the murder to be discussed. In his position as
coroner this was natural. He addressed a
counter-remark across the table to Carringford:</p>

<p>“I’ve just read the speech you made at the
Diocesan Conference on Parochial Church Councils,
Vicar. You must let me congratulate you.”</p>

<p>The clergyman, pleased with the compliment, was
launching forth on matters ecclesiastical—to the
intense boredom of Sir Peter—when the maid entered.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, someone wants to speak to Major
Renshaw on the telephone.”</p>

<p>“You know where it is, Major—in the hall,” said
Norwood.</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>The Chief Constable went to the telephone.</p>

<p>“Hullo—yes——”</p>

<p>The voice of the superintendent replied.</p>

<p>“Can you come at once, sir? It’s important.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Norwood,” he said, as he went back
into the dining-room, “but I’ll have to go—I’m
wanted.”</p>

<p>“Anything fresh—about the murder?” asked Dr.
Hazell.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the doctor, pointing a finger at him,
“you and I both get rung up in our professions.
Only there’s a difference. They call me up to save
lives—and they summon you to help in catching an
unfortunate wretch for the gallows, eh?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Good night,” replied the Chief
Constable.</p>

<p>When he reached the police station he found the
superintendent, Colson, and a strong odour of stale
beer, which emanated from the mouth of a peculiar
individual. He was a rough-looking man of about
forty, dressed in old, patched, corduroy breeches,
brow leather gaiters, and a big, loose jacket,
well-worn. He had a very red, beery-looking face,
unbrushed black hair and whiskers, and a pair of
sharp-looking dark eyes like a ferret’s. The Chief
Constable looked at him and said severely:</p>

<p>“It’s you, is it, Thatcher? What mischief have
you been up to now?”</p>

<p>The man shifted his dirty, soft hat from one hand
to the other, and replied in a surly, thick tone of
voice:</p>

<p>“I ain’t done nothin’, Major—s’elp me I ain’t.
I’ve told ’im what I come ’ere for.”</p>

<p>And he jerked his head towards the
superintendent.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, sir,” said that functionary, “he’s
come of his own accord this time. He wants to
make a statement.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“That ’ere murder—over at Marsh Quay,” said
Thatcher.</p>

<p>“What do you know about it?”</p>

<p>“Look ’ere, Major,” replied Joe Thatcher, “I
doan’t say as how I ain’t got into trouble time and
agen. <em>You</em> knows that. And I ain’t given to have
naught to do with the police as long as they lets me
aloane—which they doan’t always do, damn ’em!
But I draws the line at murder, I does. I doan’t
hold with it, and that’s why I come here to-night.”</p>

<p>“Go on. What have you got to tell us?”</p>

<p>A wicked, artful leer broke over the man’s face.
“If I tells you what I knows—you woan’t ask
me what I was a-doin’ of that night? I doan’t want
to come up before the beaks just because I was
havin’ a constitootional, as they calls it, when other
folks were asleep.”</p>

<p>“All right, Thatcher,” said the superintendent.
“We’ve got your record, and we know pretty well
what you’re up to when you take your midnight
walks abroad. But you needn’t fear in this case. If
you’ve got any information about the murder at
Marsh Quay we’ll forget the rest.”</p>

<p>“That’s what my missus said, she did. I told her
what I seen—and she says, ‘You go and tell the
police, Joe.’ I kept on sayin’ I wouldn’t, and that’s
why I didn’t come afore. An’ she kept a-naggin’
on me, till I saw life was going to be a little hell
if I didn’t come. And here I be.”</p>

<p>“Go on, my man,” said the Chief Constable
encouragingly. “There’s nothing to be afraid of; tell
us about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis like this. Saturday night I went out
for a walk—late. I doan’t say as I hadn’t a gun
wi’ me—but that’s naught to do wi’ it—be it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” said Major Renshaw with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“I got down and round about them stubble-fields
and spinneys along near the quay—but I didn’t have
no luck.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Major dryly. “We had a big shoot
there last week, and cleared out most of the birds.”</p>

<p>“So I found,” said the poacher brazenly. “Now—that
’ere wood, t’other side o’ the water. Sometimes
there’s a goodish few—sparrers, we’ll say—to
be found there, and it wouldn’t ha’ been the first
time as I’d borrowed one o’ they canoes and slipped
over for an hour or so. O’ course I returned the
canoe when I’d finished. I ain’t no thief—thank
Gawd!”</p>

<p>The others grinned at him, but were silent. It
was best for the man to tell his story in his own way.</p>

<p>“It was between half-past twelve and one as I
got down to the quay—I allus reckons to know the
time within a few minutes—’tis a habit o’ mine.
There was no one about and ’twas a still night.
There was a light on board that ’ere little yacht
where the murder was, but I didn’t hear any sound.
I was a-standin’ on the quay, a-makin’ up my mind
whether ’twas worth while crossing over, when I
heard the sound of a boat bein’ pulled across—from
the other side.”</p>

<p>“From the <em>other</em> side?” asked Colson.</p>

<p>“That’s right. I wondered what anyone was
a-doin’ that time o’ night—when respectable folk
ought to be abed and asleep.” He grinned. “I can
see pretty well in the dark—I <em>has</em> to in my
perfession—so I jist lay low and watched. Whoever it
was, he warn’t no boatman, by the way he mucked
that ’ere boat about. The tide was flowin’ in and
he had to pull hard. When he got across he made
straight for that ’ere yacht where the lights was
burnin’. Clumsy, he was, too. He didn’t ’arf bump
the nose o’ his boat into the yacht when he got to
her. You could hear the bang all over the place.”</p>

<p>“What did he do then?”</p>

<p>“Why, Major, he got aboard the yacht and went
in the cabin. I see him quite plainly. But he never
stayed there long. In less than five minutes he was
out again, clamberin’ into the boat, and pullin’ away
across stream as hard as ever he could go. Seemed
in a mighty hurry, he did. Just then I heard the
Cathedral clock strike one.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?”</p>

<p>“I lit a pipe and waited a bit—quarter of an hour
or less, I reckon. I was thinkin’ it wouldn’t do to
cross over to the wood that night. And then the
motor-car come along.”</p>

<p>“The motor-car!” ejaculated the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—come down the road.”</p>

<p>“To the quay?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. It stopped about thirty or forty yards
before it got to the quay. I could see the lights.”</p>

<p>“Did you see who was in it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I made tracks along the shore. Thinks
I, ‘There’s too many folks about to-night for an
honest chap to get a livin’,’ so I come straight home.
And that’s all about it.”</p>

<p>They questioned him sharply, but he stuck to his
story. Then the superintendent said:</p>

<p>“You’ll probably have to tell all this to the
jury—at the adjourned inquest.”</p>

<p>“It won’t get me into no trouble?” asked Thatcher.</p>

<p>“No,” said the superintendent. “We’ll see to
that.”</p>

<p>“Because,” went on the man as he rose to go,
“I’ve got my reputation to think of.”</p>

<p>“We know all about that. And look here,
Thatcher, keep your mouth shut,” said the
superintendent.</p>

<p>“How about the boats on the opposite shore?”
asked the Chief Constable when Joe Thatcher had
departed.</p>

<p>“There’s only one,” replied Colson, “belonging to
Moss.”</p>

<p>“Yes—to Moss,” said the superintendent thoughtfully.
“It looks ugly for him. We’ll see this Isaac
Moss to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to run down to Marsh Quay early
before we start,” remarked Colson.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“A little matter I want to look into. I wish
this chap Thatcher had told us all this before.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter much,” said the superintendent.
“It’s just as well to have cleared off Grayson first.
It leaves us a freer hand. I wish we knew more
about that motor.”</p>

<p>And the others agreed.</p>

<p>Early the following morning Colson was at Marsh
Quay. He sought out Jim Webb, who was still in
charge of the <i>Firefly</i>, sleeping aboard her, till he
received instructions from her owner at Salcombe.</p>

<p>“Webb,” he said, “I want you to row me over
opposite.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>“Pull to the yacht first. I want to see
something.”</p>

<p>He made Webb pull him all round the yacht
till he found what he wanted.</p>

<p>“What do you make of this?” he asked, pointing
to an indentation in her sides. The paint, especially
the narrow green band, was badly rubbed, and the
woodwork a little crushed. “Was this done before
you came here?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I’m sure it wasn’t. I noticed it on
Monday. Some of them reporter chaps—or
someone—must have banged into her. They’ve been
swarming about the place.”</p>

<p>“Might have been caused by the nose of a boat
running into her, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I think, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll go across now.”</p>

<p>When they reached the farther shore he made
for the small boat which was moored to the
landing-stage, and examined her carefully. On her bows
was a distinct smear of green paint.</p>

<p>“Humph,” said the detective, “that seems to bear
out Thatcher’s story. That’s the boat, sure enough.
Webb,” he went on, “wait here five minutes, will
you? There’s something I want to do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Colson disappeared along the pathway through
the wood, carrying under his arm a long, thin
brown-paper parcel he had brought. He began to unroll
it as he went along.</p>

<p>In ten minutes or so he returned, the parcel under
his arm, wrapped up once more. His brows knit
and he was not looking best pleased. He hardly
spoke to Jim Webb, and when he landed at once
rode off on his bicycle.</p>

<p>“That’s a frost,” he muttered to himself; “at
least, it looks like one. Anyhow, we’ll see presently
what Moss has got to say. He must be the man
who crossed over to the yacht that night. It’s
pretty suspicious. But things don’t altogether
fit—though they <em>may</em> of course.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII. <br> Isaac Moss Explains</h2>

<p>Standing on the platform of Frattenbury Station,
waiting for the London train, were Harold
Grayson and Winnie Cotterill. The superintendent,
who was in plain clothes, raised his hat.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” he said with a smile. “I
hope you won’t think we are shadowing you up
to town!”</p>

<p>“Oh, good morning, Superintendent. It certainly
looks as if I hadn’t quite escaped from your
suspicions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have, sir, I’m glad to say.”</p>

<p>“Let me introduce you to Miss Cotterill. She is
interested in this case.”</p>

<p>The superintendent raised his hat again and bowed.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Miss Cotterill,” he said, “if we’ve
caused you any anxiety about Mr. Grayson.”</p>

<p>She blushed a little as she replied:</p>

<p>“I confess it was a relief when Canon Fittleworth
told us last night that Mr. Grayson was free.”</p>

<p>An amused look lingered for a moment on the
policeman’s face as he glanced from one to the
other.</p>

<p>“I’m more than ever pleased that our suspicions
were unfounded,” he said in a dry manner. “Here
comes your train, sir. Are you both going up to
London?”</p>

<p>“We are,” said Grayson.</p>

<p>The police superintendent found an empty
compartment and showed them in.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” he said. Then he turned to
Colson, who was standing near. “Come along,
Colson. You and I won’t disturb that young
couple—and I hope nobody else will. We’ve both been
in it ourselves, eh?”</p>

<p>There were other people in their compartment,
so they maintained a rigid silence on the subject in
hand. Colson was not sorry. He wanted to study
the notes in his pocket-book and to think things out.
Arrived in London, they took a taxi to Scotland
Yard, and, after an interview with the authorities
there, went on to Hatton Garden, where they found
Tyler lounging about, also in plain clothes.</p>

<p>“Moss went into his office over an hour ago,” he
said. “You’ll find him there.”</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded and, followed by Colson,
entered a block of offices and found his way
to an upper floor. A door with ground glass panels
bore the inscription “Mr. Isaac Moss.” The
superintendent opened it without knocking, and they
found themselves in a little outer office. A girl,
seated at a typewriter, rose hastily.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Moss in?”</p>

<p>“He’s particularly engaged, sir. He can’t see
anyone.”</p>

<p>“Oh—indeed! But I must see him.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you can’t,” said the girl. “He told
me not to let anyone in—that I didn’t know.”
The superintendent smiled at the girl’s
ingenuousness.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I’m afraid I must make you
disobey orders. I’m a police superintendent.”
The girl paled a little, and went towards an inner
door marked “Private.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him,” she said.</p>

<p>But the superintendent was too quick for her.
He was across the room in a moment.</p>

<p>“You must do what I tell you,” he said. “Open
the door. Don’t be afraid.”</p>

<p>As she opened the door a voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Who is it? I told you I couldn’t see anyone.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we must come in, all the same, Mr.
Moss,” said the superintendent, entering the room
and followed by Colson.</p>

<p>A little dark man of evident Jewish persuasion,
with a thin, black moustache, half rose from the
chair in which he was seated. His face was deadly
pale, his mouth was half open and his lips quivering.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asked, his voice shaking.
“I don’t know you.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Mr. Moss,” broke in the
superintendent closing the door, turning the lock and
putting the key in his pocket. “I almost think you
might have expected me to call. I’m Superintendent
Norton, of the Frattenbury police”—he laid his card
on the table—“and this is Detective-Sergeant
Colson.”</p>

<p>Then occurred a pitiable exhibition. Mr. Isaac
Moss sank back in his chair, a cold sweat breaking
out on his forehead, wringing his hands in a
paroxysm of fright.</p>

<p>“I never murdered Mr. Templeton,” he said. “I
don’t know anything about it. I wasn’t there. I
tell you it’s no use you arresting me—I’m innocent.
I never touched him. I knew you’d come. Oh,”
he moaned, “I knew you’d come, but I never
murdered him, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Mr. Moss,” said the superintendent
in a soothing tone, “I haven’t made any charge
against you yet. I warn you that the way you’re
going on will do you no good. Pull yourself
together. I want to ask you some questions. Why,
we detained a man yesterday who had every cause
to be alarmed, with the facts there were against
him, and he took it coolly enough.”</p>

<p>“He’s the man!” shrieked Moss. “He must be
the man. You haven’t let him go, have you? Why
do you come to me? He’s the man, I tell you.”</p>

<p>Colson regarded the little writhing wretch with
contempt mingled with pity. In his mind he was
saying: “<em>He</em> hasn’t got spunk enough to stab a
fellow—even in his back.”</p>

<p>The superintendent looked round the room.</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to have any whisky—or
brandy handy, do you?”</p>

<p>Isaac Moss sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have,” he cried. “You shall have a
drink—of course you shall have a drink. You see
it was the other man, don’t you? Here——”</p>

<p>He had dashed to a cupboard and produced a
bottle of whisky, a siphon and glasses. One of the
latter fell to the floor with a crash. The
superintendent poured out a stiff portion of the spirit,
filled the glass up with soda-water and handed it
to the terrified man.</p>

<p>“Drink it,” he said. “Sit down now, and pull
yourself together.”</p>

<p>Moss gulped down the contents of the tumbler
and sat looking at them. A slight colour came
into his cheeks, but he was still trembling. The
superintendent waited.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Moss presently, in
a slightly calmer tone of voice.</p>

<p>“Well, in the first place, bear in mind that I
haven’t arrested you. I want to ask you some
questions.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he had come determined to
take Moss into custody. But he was accustomed
to dealing with criminals, and had already half made
up his mind that he need only detain him. And
Moss had had fright enough as it was.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said the Jew faintly.</p>

<p>“Well, then, will you tell us why you left your
house near Marsh Quay so early and so suddenly
on Sunday morning?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t leave it suddenly,” said Moss. “I had
business in London—important business. I often
come up on Sunday morning by that train.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do, Mr. Moss,” said the superintendent,
shaking his head. “We know you gave a sudden
and unexpected order for your car early that
morning. We know you are not in the habit of coming
up to town on Sunday at all. For your own sake
you’d better tell us the truth and hide nothing.”</p>

<p>The little man wiped the sweat off his brow.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I’ll tell you the truth. I came
away because I was frightened. So help me God,
that’s true.”</p>

<p>“Frightened of what?”</p>

<p>“Lest I should be accused of being mixed up
in Mr. Templeton’s murder.”</p>

<p>“How did you hear of his murder?”</p>

<p>“My man told me—early Sunday morning.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do, Mr. Moss,” repeated the
superintendent. “You had left the house before it was
known that the murder had taken place. Come—if
you can’t tell me the truth, I shall have to take
you away.”</p>

<p>Isaac Moss wrung his hands.</p>

<p>“No—no!” he cried, “don’t do that. My man
didn’t tell me. That was a lie. But I knew—I tell
you I knew.”</p>

<p>The superintendent looked at his notebook for
a moment. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>“It would help us—and you, too—if you would
tell us what you were doing on board Mr.
Templeton’s yacht at one o’clock on Sunday morning.”</p>

<p>Moss started to his feet again.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t there,” he cried. “You’re mistaken.
I wasn’t there.”</p>

<p>“You <em>were</em> there,” said the superintendent sternly.
“I’ll give you one more chance of speaking the truth,
and if you don’t I’ll charge you with the murder
of Reginald Templeton and take you into custody.”</p>

<p>The wretched man sank into his chair again.
Then he said, almost in a whisper:</p>

<p>“Very well, then—I was there.”</p>

<p>“That’s better,” said the superintendent. “We’ll
go into that further in a moment. Now then,”
and he made a shot in the dark, “what have you
done with the diamonds you took from Mr.
Templeton?”</p>

<p>A little to the surprise of the two policemen the
Jew, who was growing calmer under the influence
of the stimulant, rose from his seat, unlocked a safe,
took from it a small leather bag, very much like the
one that had been found on the dead man, and
poured its contents on the table.</p>

<p>“There they are,” he said, “all but one—and
that was the cause of the trouble.”</p>

<p>“You stole these diamonds?”</p>

<p>“<em>Stole</em> them!” cried Moss. “<em>I</em> steal! Of course
I never stole them. Ask anybody about me, and
they’ll tell you I’m a regular dealer in the stones.
Besides—I gave Templeton the receipt for them.
Didn’t you find it? He put it in his pocket-book.
I saw him do it.”</p>

<p>The superintendent looked at Colson, who elevated
his eyebrows, but said nothing. Both men were a
little out of their reckoning. Then the
superintendent said to Moss:</p>

<p>“See here, Mr. Moss. We police have a duty to
do, but no innocent person need be afraid of us.
We only want to secure the guilty. And we’re
always ready to help the innocent when we can. We
know you were on Mr. Templeton’s yacht—we know
he had been with you on Saturday afternoon—and
we know you left in the devil of a hurry and
took these diamonds with you. You will serve
your purpose, and ours, best by telling us all you
know.”</p>

<p>Isaac Moss took out his cigarette case.</p>

<p>“Do you mind if I smoke?”</p>

<p>“By all means.”</p>

<p>He poured himself out some more whisky, drank
it and said:</p>

<p>“Where do you want me to begin?”</p>

<p>“At the point when you had an interview with
Templeton on Saturday afternoon. Tell us <em>why</em> he
came to you.”</p>

<p>“It was about these diamonds. I am agent for
a firm in South Africa, Ehbrenstein &amp; Co.—a
well-known firm. They wrote telling me they had a
consignment of uncut stones which they wished me
to take to Amsterdam—to be cut, in the usual way
of business. We are always very careful, of course,
in these consignments, and if there is anyone well
known to the firms or dealers coming over, it is a
common thing to ask him to bring them. My letter
of advice told me that Mr. Templeton—whom I
knew slightly—would bring them over, and that I
was to give him the receipt on delivery. It would,
of course, be a matter of commission for him. The
letter also said that he would communicate with me
when he reached England. He didn’t at first. I
knew the boat on which he was sailing had arrived
in Plymouth, and grew anxious, especially as I
knew that Templeton was an erratic and peculiar
man, with little regard for business methods. Then
I heard from him—from Poole—saying he was
yachting on the South Coast, probably finishing up
at a little place called Marsh Quay, when he would
run up to town and deliver the stones. He also
told me to write to him at the G.P.O., Ryde, if I
had anything to say. I was getting still more
anxious, and wrote at once, suggesting that as, by a
coincidence, I had a week-end place at Marsh Quay,
he should bring me the stones there. I described
exactly where my house stood. He replied saying
he would be with me on Saturday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we know that,” said the superintendent.</p>

<p>“I was sitting on my lawn when he came. We
talked a bit there, and then went into the
house—into my study, and had a whisky and soda each.
It was there that he produced these stones—in a
little bag like this one—and I turned them out on
the table and counted them. There were
thirty-two—the correct number. I put them back in the
bag and gave him the receipt. Just before he went
he said, ‘I’d like to keep that little bag. I’ve
carried it a good many hundred miles.’ I said,
‘Certainly.’ I unlocked a drawer in my writing-desk,
emptied the stones into a little tin box, locked it up
and gave him the bag. Then I walked down to my
landing-stage and watched him row back to his
yacht. That was the last I saw of him—alive.”</p>

<p>He drank a sip or two out of his glass; he was
beginning to get agitated again.</p>

<p>“Take your time,” said the superintendent. “Tell
us everything, mind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will. When my wife and I went to bed
that night it was late—after twelve. I took the
little box containing the stones with me—I have a
small safe in our bedroom. Before I put them
away the thought struck me that I would count
them. To my horror, there were only thirty-one—one
of the largest was missing. You must remember
that these stones are worth a considerable sum,
and I only hold them as agent—but I am responsible
for them. My wife and I talked it over, and came
to the conclusion that I must have left one stone
in the bag when I emptied them out the second time.
I was in a dilemma. For all I knew, Templeton
might be off with the tide very early the next
morning—he hadn’t told me his movements. Then I
looked out of the window—you can see across the
estuary over the trees. I could make out a light.
Now, I know the position of the lights there, and
I knew at once it couldn’t be the inn or the house in
which—what’s his name?—the old retired cigar
merchant lives. Yes?”</p>

<p>Colson had sprung to an upright position on his
chair.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” he asked. “A cigar
merchant? Who?”</p>

<p>“Why—he lived in the house opposite the
‘Mariner’s Arms’—ah—Proctor’s his name. Didn’t
you know?”</p>

<p>“Was he in the cigar trade?”</p>

<p>“Yes—till about two years ago. I knew him
slightly up here; in fact, it was I who told him
about that house of his being for sale.”</p>

<p>Colson gave a low whistle and exchanged glances
with the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Sorry I interrupted. Go on, Mr. Moss.”</p>

<p>“Well, from the position of the light, I guessed
it must be on Templeton’s yacht, and that he had
not yet turned in. I didn’t know, as I told you,
whether he might not be off—even soon, for the
tide would be on the turn between one and two.
And I hadn’t the slightest idea how to get hold of
him if he left, so I said to my wife, ‘I’ll get that
stone now. Templeton’s evidently on his yacht.’
‘How?’ she asked. ‘Why,’ I replied, ‘it’s quite
simple; it’s only a question of pulling over in the
boat.’ At first she was rather inclined to dissuade
me, but she saw how anxious I was to get the stone
back, so at last she said, ‘Well, hurry up, then,
Isaac, and get it over. I want to go to sleep—and
don’t stop gossiping with Mr. Templeton.’ ”</p>

<p>“And you went?” put in the superintendent.</p>

<p>Moss nodded, took a drink and went on.</p>

<p>“I did. It wasn’t so easy as I thought. The
tide was running in hard, and I’m not much of a
hand with a boat. I had to pull with all my might,
and when I got to the calmer water, where the
yacht lay, I still pulled so hard that I ran into her
with a bit of a bump. I was rather surprised that
no one took any notice; it must have shaken her.”</p>

<p>“Well, I fastened my boat to the yacht and got
aboard. There wasn’t a sound. The cabin door was
open, and I went in. The hanging lamp was
burning. I looked round, and there I saw Templeton
lying on the floor—face downwards. At first I
thought he was asleep, or drunk. Then I stooped
down. Ah, my God—it’s haunted me ever since!”</p>

<p>He leaned forward for a moment and covered his
face with his hands. Then he went on.</p>

<p>“There was a pool of blood on the floor; he was
dead.”</p>

<p>“Yes—and then?” asked the superintendent.</p>

<p>“I—I—thought I should have fainted. I sat
down on one of the bunks for a minute. Then the
horror of the thing took hold of me. If I were
discovered—what would be the position? It flashed
across me instantly—that dark night—no one else
about—I saw it all. They would think <em>I</em> did it.</p>

<p>“I got out of that cabin in a panic and into my
boat. I don’t know how I managed to get across—it
seemed hours—and I pulled till my arms ached
with pain. As soon as I reached my house I ran
upstairs and told my wife what had happened. She
was as frightened as myself—she saw the danger.
We neither of us got a wink of sleep that night.
We kept talking it over, and at last we both agreed
that the wisest thing to do would be to get away
very early in the morning—we hoped before the
discovery was made.”</p>

<p>“The worst thing you could have done,” interposed
Colson. “It naturally drew suspicion upon
you at once. We knew Templeton had been with
you in the afternoon, and one of the first things
we did was to try to get hold of you—and found
you’d bolted.”</p>

<p>“I know—I know,” said Moss. “I’ve been in
terror ever since. I’ve sat in this office, trying to
do business, and expecting every moment to see
the police come in—it’s been agony.”</p>

<p>“What you ought to have done,” said the
superintendent, “was to give the alarm—at Marsh
Quay—directly you discovered the body.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—but even suppose I had—wouldn’t
you have suspected me? I don’t know. I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>The superintendent did not answer. He was
thinking what <em>he</em> would have done, if he had been
a nervous, cowardly man in a like predicament.
And he had to agree, mentally, that the Jew had
acted according to his natural temperament.</p>

<p>“That’s the whole truth, so help me God!” said
Moss earnestly, “and I’m glad I’ve told you now;
it’s a blessed relief. I couldn’t have gone on much
longer. What are you going to do with me?” he
asked, throwing out his hands in appealing gesture.</p>

<p>The superintendent did not reply for a moment.
He was considering. Then Colson whispered
something to him, and he nodded.</p>

<p>“Sergeant Colson wants to ask you a
question—before we decide anything.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said the Jew.</p>

<p>“I may as well tell you,” said Colson, “that you
have been under strict observation for the last few
days. But there’s one thing I want to know. When
you and your wife came up to London on Sunday
morning, apparently you did not go to your house
in Brondesbury. We’ve ascertained that you only
went there on Monday. Where were you on Sunday
night? If you can tell us that, and bring witnesses
to prove the truth of it, it will materially
help you.”</p>

<p>He was, of course, thinking of the incident of the
walking-stick. Already he was more than half satisfied
with the Jew’s story—it fitted in with his own
deductions. But he wanted to make quite sure.
For this would help him still more.</p>

<p>“No—we didn’t go home,” said Moss, “we were
not expected—our two maids at Brondesbury had
the week-end off. We went to an hotel and stayed
the Sunday night there.”</p>

<p>“What hotel?”</p>

<p>“The ‘Chester.’ ”</p>

<p>“Will you come with us to the ‘Chester’ now?”
asked the superintendent. “We should like to
corroborate this statement.”</p>

<p>“Certainly—I will come.”</p>

<p>“Go down and get a taxi,” said the superintendent
to Colson, “and ask Tyler to come with us.”</p>

<p>The Jew was putting on his overcoat as Colson
left the room; he turned a nervous, inquiring glance
on the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Tyler is one of our men,” said the latter dryly.
“He’s been shadowing you since Monday. I hope,”
he added, in a more kindly tone, “to take him back
with us to Frattenbury.”</p>

<p>Arrived at the “Chester,” the superintendent
produced his card and asked to see the manager. A
few minutes later they were closeted with him in his
private office.</p>

<p>“I want you to tell us,” said the superintendent,
“whether this gentleman,” and he indicated Moss,
“stayed here on Sunday night last.”</p>

<p>“The name?”</p>

<p>“Moss—Isaac Moss.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Wait here a moment, and I’ll make
inquiries.”</p>

<p>“I should like to have everything corroborated.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>The manager returned after a brief interval,
bringing with him the booking clerk, the hall porter
and a chambermaid. The booking clerk at once
recognised Moss, produced his registration
signature, and the entry in the book. The chambermaid
stated that he and his wife had occupied room
number 87.</p>

<p>“Can any of you swear—I warn you that it may
have to come to that—that Mr. Moss was in the
hotel all Sunday night?”</p>

<p>“Up to twelve o’clock would be enough,” broke
in Colson.</p>

<p>“I can do that,” said the hall porter; “at least
I know he was here from nine p.m. till midnight.
He sat in the lounge most of the time. I saw him
writing a letter, which he gave me to post just
before he went to bed—a minute or two after
twelve. I saw him get into the lift, and said good
night to him. I’m quite prepared to swear to this.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the superintendent, “that’s all
I want to know. Can we be alone—my friends and
I—for a minute or two?” he asked the manager.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Make use of this room. Nothing
wrong, I hope, superintendent?”</p>

<p>“No—it’s all right.”</p>

<p>When the manager and the others had gone, the
superintendent said:</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Moss, I’ve decided not to take you
into custody, though I may as well tell you now
that I quite intended to do so. You’ve been
exceedingly imprudent, and you’ve had a narrow
escape. As to these diamonds”—he had put them
back in the bag and pocketed them—“can you
satisfy me that you have a right to them?”</p>

<p>“I have all the correspondence relating to them
in my office—and I can bring another proof. Ehbrenstein
&amp; Co. sent full particulars of the transaction
to another of their London agents—this is frequently
done, as a covering precaution.”</p>

<p>“Very good, we will return to your office and see
this agent. If it is as you say, I am prepared to
leave the stones with you.”</p>

<p>“How about—how about the other stone—you
found it on Mr. Templeton, I hope?”</p>

<p>The man’s Jewish instincts were predominating
now that the crisis was over.</p>

<p>“You’ll get that—in good time. Now, Mr. Moss,
I don’t want to have any further trouble with you.
If all is as you say, and I allow you your freedom,
you must be prepared to tell your story to the jury
at the remanded inquest. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Do you think,” hesitated Moss, a little of his
terror returning, “that they’d be likely to return
a verdict of—of—murder against me?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter in the least what they do,”
said the policeman with fine sarcasm in his opinion
of the brain powers of the “twelve good men and
true.” “It’s only a coroner’s jury. We might have,
in that case, for form’s sake, to bring you before
the magistrates’ court. But you’d never get
committed for trial. <em>We’ll</em> see to that.”</p>

<p>The end of it was that the superintendent expressed
himself satisfied, released Isaac Moss, and
returned to Frattenbury with Colson. In the course
of the journey the detective remarked:</p>

<p>“I never expected we should find Moss to be our
man. When I showed his housekeeper and her husband
that stick this morning, pretending I had found
it in their master’s boat, and they both denied that
they had ever seen it before, I felt pretty certain.
Besides, I thought beforehand that the stick was
too long to be used by a little man like Moss. Well,
that settles <em>his</em> book,” and he rubbed his hands.
“We’ve eliminated <em>two</em> out of the three. Now we’ll
go for the last one. A cigar merchant, eh, sir?
That’s a bit significant.”</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, Colson?”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me for a bit, sir. I’ve got a card
up my sleeve that ought to take the trick. And
I’ll play it—before the adjourned inquest!”</p>

<p>Smoking his pipe that evening, in his snug little
home, he related the events of the day to his wife.</p>

<p>“And now for Mr. Joseph Proctor, retired cigar
merchant!” he exclaimed gleefully.</p>

<p>She took his hand as she sat beside him.</p>

<p>“Be careful dear!” she said.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You’ve just told me that Mr. Moss is a little
man, and would scarcely have carried a long
walking-stick.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t Mr. Proctor a little man, too?”</p>

<p>“Confound it!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then his face lightened. “It’s all right,” he said.
“If he bought the stick in Switzerland he’d have
to take what they’d got. And he wouldn’t use it
in the ordinary way there—in climbing with it.
Besides——”</p>

<p>“Besides what?”</p>

<p>“There’s more ways than one of carrying a
walking-stick, my dear. I’ve observed that. Little men
often simply <em>carry</em> them—I mean, they don’t hold
them by the handle and stick the point in the ground
when they walk.”</p>

<p>She squeezed his hand fondly.</p>

<p>“You are a silly old dear,” she said with a laugh.
“That reasoning might have applied to Mr. Moss,
you know.”</p>

<p>“One for you,” he replied. “Never mind, old
girl, Moss is out of the game now.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV. <br> Reginald Templeton’s Letter</h2>

<p>Anthony Crosby looked up with a smile as
Winnie Cotterill was ushered into his private office.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Cotterill. Very glad to see
you,” he said, getting up from his chair and shaking
hands with the girl. “You got my note, then?”</p>

<p>“You said you wanted to see me, Mr. Crosby.”</p>

<p>“I did. Sit down, won’t you? Now I dare say
you’ve been wondering why I’ve enticed you into
my office, eh?”</p>

<p>“Is it anything about Mr. Templeton’s murder?”
asked Winnie as she sat down.</p>

<p>“Well—er—in a way it is.”</p>

<p>“Have the police found out yet who did it?” asked
the girl eagerly.</p>

<p>The lawyer took up some typewritten sheets lying
on his table and glanced at them.</p>

<p>“The superintendent at Frattenbury has been
good enough to send me a private report,” he
replied. “I don’t think I’m betraying their confidence
when I tell you that so far they haven’t laid
their hands on the villain. There was another man
they suspected—besides Mr. Grayson—but he seems
to have cleared himself.”</p>

<p>Winnie had taken off her gloves. The observant
lawyer glanced at her left hand.</p>

<p>“You’re very glad Mr. Grayson is no longer
suspected?” he asked dryly.</p>

<p>The girl blushed a little, smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “You see—since I saw you
last——”</p>

<p>“You’ve added to your jewellery, eh, Miss
Cotterill?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Grayson asked me to marry him, and I
said——”</p>

<p>“ ‘Yes.’ I’m not surprised. Let me offer you my
congratulations. When are you going to be
married?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’ll be ever so long a time. You see,
Harold’s got to make his way as an artist. He’s
the youngest son. He’s getting on, of course. But
we shall have to wait a bit.”</p>

<p>“And you—do you manage to earn your own
living?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—just, you know. I haven’t been able
to save anything. But I’m getting along nicely.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, Miss Cotterill, we’ll dismiss this
naturally pleasant subject for a time, if you don’t
mind. I’ll tell you why I asked you to call. I
suppose you know that my late client was much
interested in you?”</p>

<p>“Uncle?—Mr. Templeton? He was most awfully
good to me.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if you know why?” said the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I’ve often tried to guess—I’ve
wondered if he was fond of my mother, you know?”</p>

<p>Crosby nodded. “Yes—he was, Miss Cotterill.
He was in love with her before she married.”</p>

<p>A deep blush spread over the girl’s face.</p>

<p>“You haven’t sent for me to tell me he—he was
my fa——”</p>

<p>“No, no, no, my dear young lady. I assure you.
Besides, you probably remember your father?”</p>

<p>And he looked at her keenly.</p>

<p>“Yes—very faintly. You see, I was very young
when he died—I couldn’t have been more than four
years old. I can just remember him—not what he
was like, you know. That’s all. I asked
because—because my mother hardly ever mentioned him—she
didn’t seem to care to talk about him—and I
wondered——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” interposed the lawyer sympathetically.
“I understand. Well, you can dismiss any such
thought from your mind.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell me anything about my father?”</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>“No, I can’t tell you anything about him. But
I can tell you something that ought to please you,”
he went on with a smile. “Mr. Templeton made
his will, and left it with me before he went to South
Africa. Here it is,” and he held up a paper. “Can
you guess the contents?”</p>

<p>“How can I, Mr. Crosby?”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s left everything of which he died
possessed to you!”</p>

<p>“To <em>me</em>!” she exclaimed, in astonishment. “Oh,
no—there must be some mistake.”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s very rude of you to doubt a lawyer’s word,
my dear young lady. And you ought not to be
surprised. His only relations, apparently, were the
Fittleworths, and they’re quite well off. Now, don’t
jump to conclusions. You’re not going to be an
heiress by any means, so don’t you think it. Mr.
Templeton wasn’t at all rich, and he spent most
of his money in travelling and fitting out expeditions.
I’ve been looking over his affairs, and you’ll
only get two thousand pounds at the outside.”</p>

<p>“Two thousand pounds!” cried Winnie. “I never
expected to have so much money in all my life. Do
you really mean it?”</p>

<p>“I wish everyone was as modest in their ideas of
money as you are. No I don’t, though—I should
have to lower my fees! Yes, it’s about two thousand,
as far as I can make out. Now, what are you
going to do with it?”</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair and smiled at her.
Visions of gowns, hats, jewellery, furniture, and
finally a trousseau flitted through the girl’s mind.
And the lawyer, who had a knowledge of human
nature—intensified by being a married
man—shrewdly guessed several of the visions.</p>

<p>“I—don’t—know,” said Winnie slowly. “There
are ever so many things, and——”</p>

<p>“Now look here, Miss Cotterill,” broke in Crosby,
“may I presume to give you a bit of advice? If
you invest the money carefully, it ought to bring
you in a hundred a year.”</p>

<p>He knew what the answer would be. And it was.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Crosby, can’t I have <em>some</em> of it to spend
now?”</p>

<p>“You can have the whole lot if you like—when
we’ve taken out probate. It’s yours absolutely.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t want to spend it <em>all</em>. I shouldn’t
know how to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I expect you would. Anyhow—I don’t want
to force myself on you—but will you let me arrange
matters? Suppose you have a hundred pounds and
let me invest the remainder for you, eh?”</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“That would be just ripping!” she said. “Thank
you ever so much.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll see about taking out probate,
and let you know when I shall want you again.”</p>

<p>He had adopted his professional manner and
looked at his watch markedly.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything else just now. Good-bye,
Miss Cotterill; and hearty congratulations—in a
double sense.”</p>

<p>When Winnie Cotterill had departed, the lawyer
took up another paper that was lying on his desk, and
read it carefully. The sealed packet he had
mentioned to Canon Fittleworth had contained it. It
was in the form of a letter from Reginald Templeton.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p class="salutation">My Dear Crosby,</p>

  <p>We are all of us in the lap of the gods, and
  sometimes they drop us before we think they will.
  Anyhow, when a man starts, as I am starting, for
  some considerable time abroad, one never knows
  what may happen. So this is for your private
  eye in case I cut the traces or they are cut for
  me—and don’t see you again.</p>

  <p>You have my will, in which I leave the little
  I’ve got to Winnie Cotterill—and I expect you
  know the reason. But there’s something else I
  want to tell you about the girl, which I think you
  ought to know in case the unforeseen may
  happen—as it does sometimes. Her name isn’t really
  Cotterill at all—it’s Forbes. Don’t start, my
  friend, there’s nothing wrong with her parentage.
  The facts are these. Her mother, Mabel Cotterill,
  didn’t marry me as I hoped she would. She
  chose a man named Percy Forbes, a young lawyer.
  He turned out a wrong ’un. When Winifred was
  about four years old, he was tried on a serious
  charge of embezzlement, and sentenced to seven
  years’ penal servitude. He hadn’t got a leg to
  stand upon, it was a clear case. He and his wife
  were living at the time—well, it doesn’t matter
  where. But Mrs. Forbes naturally left the
  neighbourhood; in fact I advised her to do so. The
  question arose about Winifred. The mother
  didn’t want the child to hear of the family
  disgrace, so she went to a neighbourhood where
  nobody knew her, and took her maiden name of
  Cotterill. We used to talk over matters
  sometimes—as to what would happen when Forbes
  came out of prison—and she hated the thought
  of the child ever knowing that her father had been
  a convict. But Forbes didn’t come out of prison—he
  died at Princetown in the third year of his
  sentence. So Winifred was brought up to believe
  that he died when she was four years old—and
  that’s all she knows. And her mother stuck to
  the name of Cotterill.</p>

  <p>What do I want you to do? Probably nothing,
  my friend. I trust you to keep up the fiction. A
  name doesn’t matter, and the girl will, I hope,
  marry some good fellow, and so get another name
  that she’s a right to. You will agree that it is best
  not to let her have the burden of her father’s
  disgrace.</p>

  <p><em>But</em>—and this is the real object of this letter—if
  ever there’s a question of her benefiting by the
  knowledge (I don’t suppose there ever will be), I
  wanted you to know the facts. It seemed to me
  to be only fair to her. And, in that case, I ask
  you to use <em>your own discretion</em>—just as I should
  have done. You’re a wiser man than I am but
  even I could solve the problem as to whether it
  would be better for the girl to know of her father’s
  crime for the sake of any material advantage that
  might occur, or whether a mind based on the
  contentment of ignorance is not really worth more
  than worldly dross.</p>

  <p>I know I’m a queer chap, and it’s because I’m
  queer that I haven’t mentioned places. You’re
  shrewd enough to find out the facts for yourself if
  occasion arises. And as the finding out of the
  facts would take you a little time, I’ve tied you up,
  so that you can have plenty of leisure for decision.</p>

  <p>That’s all. If the aforementioned gods drop
  me, you’ll see that Winifred gets my little lot of
  possessions. And to recompense you for this—and
  for making further investigations if you have
  to do so—please take the enclosed bank-note for
  a hundred pounds, with every good wish from</p>

  <p class="valediction">Your sincere friend,</p>
  <p class="signature">Reginald Templeton.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The lawyer carefully replaced this document in its
envelope and locked it up.</p>

<p>“A queer letter,” he said to himself; “but then,
Templeton was not an ordinary sort of man. Of
course, I can easily find out about this fellow
Forbes, if I want to, but it seems to me, at present,
that there’s nothing to do—yes, it wouldn’t be fair
to tell the girl. I can quite understand the policy of
bringing her up in ignorance of her father’s crime.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway,” he went on, “this matter has
nothing to do with the murder.”</p>

<p>He took up the superintendent’s letter and read
it again.</p>

<p>“So Moss is out of the running,” he soliloquised,
“and the diamonds are accounted for. So it could
hardly be robbery—unless,” and he went on thoughtfully,
“unless, of course, someone else knew he had
those diamonds on him—and did not know he had
handed them over to Moss. That looks feasible.
It’s a rational motive for the crime. I wonder who
this other suspect is that the police say they have
an eye on?</p>

<p>“There’s another queer thing about this murder,”
he reflected. “Hardly any papers were found in
the cabin, and none on Templeton’s body. Yet
there were about thirty pounds in notes in the open
locker. If the murderer was after the diamonds,
and didn’t find them, why did he take any papers?
For Templeton must have had a pocket-book or
something on him. It’s a rum case. I wonder if
the police will ever solve it. Well, perhaps there
will be some fresh light at the inquest. Anyhow,
I can’t give any more time to it just now.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before Winnie Cotterill saw
Grayson. He called at the flat and had tea. Maude
Wingrave came in just after he had arrived.</p>

<p>Winnie told them the news.</p>

<p>“Poor Uncle!” she said; “I’d rather not have
had the money when it means his death, of course.
But I just can’t help being excited. Look here,
you children! You’ve both got to dine with me
to-night—at the ‘Petit Cygne.’ I’ll stand treat.”</p>

<p>“Squanderer!” derided Maude. “Beware, Mr.
Grayson! She’ll throw your money about like ducks
and drakes. I don’t think I’ll come, Winnie.”</p>

<p>“Why not, old thing?”</p>

<p>“You two irresponsible young persons having
entered upon the broad downward path that leadeth
into the narrow straights of matrimony with insufficient
income will do all the talking to one another—and
it will be appalling to listen unto. That’s
why.”</p>

<p>“I’ll promise to address quite a lot of remarks to
you,” said Grayson.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know—‘Don’t you think Winnie looks
charming to-night?’ and all that sort of
unbearable——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Maude—don’t be rude. Please excuse
her, Harold. I’m trying to teach her manners—she
spent the extra tuppence on frivolity. You’ll both
come, and there’s an end of it.”</p>

<p>“The end of it will be that I shall leave you two
children at the close of the meal, see?”</p>

<p>“<em>We</em> don’t mind, do we, Harold?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” replied Grayson, as if he meant it.</p>

<p>“You’re not polite, Mr. Grayson,” said Maude.
“If you don’t treat me with due respect, I shall
stay till the bitter end.”</p>

<p>But, being a good-hearted girl, of course she
didn’t.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV. <br> Detective-Sergeant Colson’s Deductions</h2>

<p>The newspaper paragraphs about the murder at
Marsh Quay dwindled in length. There were several
scathing leading articles dealing with the inefficiency
of the local police, and expounding the systems that
ought to be put into force. One leader-writer
produced an article conclusively proving that the
Government was to blame. Writers of that peculiar
terse and asterisked matter—the editor, it is
presumed, puts in the asterisks in exchange for the
copy he deletes—which adorns the “magazine” page
of certain of our morning papers reaped a small
crop of guineas. Thus one of them described the
manufacture of cigar bands another epitomised half
a dozen yacht tragedies, and a third gave a graphic
sketch of how he himself had sailed in the Marsh
Quay estuary.</p>

<p>The Sunday papers, of course, had their
contributions. “An Expert in Crime” brilliantly
reconstructed the whole murder, hinted at clues which
the police ought to have found, and, without
mentioning any names, left the impression on the mind
of the reader that the two sailor-men, to wit, Jim
Webb and Tom Gale, had acted in collusion, with the
assistance of Mrs. Yates, who had countenanced a
mysterious rendezvous at the “Mariner’s Arms.”</p>

<p>The police were inundated with letters—suggestive
and critical. People called at the police
station to make statements, which were patiently
received and laid on one side. But, as usual, the
police quietly kept their own counsel and were
unimpressed.</p>

<p>Colson, who was now in the best of spirits, called
on Canon Fittleworth.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said the Canon, “but my list isn’t
quite complete yet. I shall have to make a few
more efforts of memory, as Major Renshaw puts it.
I’m not satisfied.”</p>

<p>“What list, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, the names of all the people I can remember
who smoked any of my cigars.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>that</em>!” exclaimed the detective. “Yes, I
know. But it wasn’t about that list that I called—later
on will do very well. I came to ask you for
the name and address of your friend in Cuba who
sent you the cigars.”</p>

<p>“My Spanish friend. Certainly. I’ll write it down
for you. What do you want it for?” he asked, as
he passed it over to Colson.</p>

<p>“Oh—it may be useful,” said the detective in a
non-committal manner. “One never knows.”</p>

<p>“Any further progress?”</p>

<p>The Canon, of course, was interested.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t ask me, please, sir. We’re doing
all we can.”</p>

<p>Later on that day the police sent a cablegram to
Cuba, asking for certain information. Also, Colson
ran up to London, and was closeted for some time
with the managing director of a reputable firm of
wholesale cigar importers, from whom he gathered
certain details which he carefully entered in his
notebook.</p>

<p>“They’re first-rate cigars, aren’t they?” asked the
managing director at the close of the interview. “Of
course, there are very few of them manufactured.
We keep them to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about them in that way,”
replied the detective dryly. “I haven’t smoked one.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you? Well, you shall then. I’ve got
some of them here. Take half a dozen. Anything
else I can do for you, let me know. So you know
Proctor, eh? Nice little chap. Asked me to run
down and see him some day.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather you said nothing about my visit, if
you do, sir. You will understand I’ve been asking
you for this information in confidence.”</p>

<p>“Quite. I won’t say a word. Not that I’m likely
to see him yet awhile.”</p>

<p>The detective agreed that the brand was an
excellent one as he smoked one of the cigars on his
return journey. He also read, in the evening paper,
one of the aforenamed articles on the lethargy of
the provincial police—and enjoyed it immensely.
But, then, he was in the mood for enjoying anything
just then.</p>

<p>“By the way, Colson,” said the superintendent to
him when they were in consultation that evening,
“have you made any more progress with that
blotting-paper puzzle, ‘Ezra’s ices’?”</p>

<p>“Not much, sir. I think I’ve found out two or
three more words. But I don’t attach importance
to it. We’ve something more definite than that to
go upon.”</p>

<p>“True—but I’d bear it in mind all the same. We
mustn’t neglect any detail.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir. I’m feeling a little bit off colour,”
he went on, with a grin. “I think a little fresh air
will do me good. So I propose taking a day’s
holiday to-morrow and spending it at Marsh Quay.
I may even stay the night, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Colson,” replied the superintendent,
grinning at him in return. “I hope it will set you
up. Don’t get into mischief.”</p>

<p>“I may commit a burglary, sir—that’s all. It’s a
fascinating game when you’re on a holiday. If
possible—if I get any luck, that is—it won’t come
off. But I’ll come back and give myself up to you
if it does.”</p>

<p>Colson seemed about to carry out his threat next
day by taking with him a jimmy, a strong
pocket-knife, and a bunch of skeleton keys—carefully
selected from trophies at the police station.</p>

<p>The house in which Proctor resided at Marsh
Quay was exactly opposite the spot where the yacht
had been anchored. The main entrance was from
the road, just before the quay was reached. A low
stone wall, running parallel with the estuary,
bordered the garden on the western side, and a small
gate led through this wall to the shore; in fact
Proctor had come out of this gate when he had
accosted Jim Webb and Mrs. Yates on the morning
when the murder was discovered.</p>

<p>The <i>Firefly</i> was no longer riding in the little
harbour. Acting on the instructions of her owner,
Jim Webb by this time was sailing her back to
Salcombe. Local interest in the scene of the murder
had subsided, and the detective had the place
practically to himself.</p>

<p>He had found out all that he could about Mr.
Proctor’s household and habits. That was not
very difficult. The unsuspecting landlady of the
“Mariner’s Arms,” in the course of an apparently
casual conversation, had told him that the boy
Philip had left, and that his great-uncle was once
more by himself. He also gathered that Proctor’s
domestic establishment consisted of an elderly
cook-housekeeper and a young maidservant, both of whom
slept at the back of the house, while Proctor
himself occupied a bedroom over the dining-room with
a view, south and west, of the estuary.</p>

<p>He further ascertained that it was the little man’s
usual habit, when alone, to walk into Frattenbury in
the afternoon, where he read the papers at a club.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon now, and he had seen Proctor
start towards Frattenbury across the field path, so
he felt free and unobserved. There were several
things that he wanted to do. First of all he wanted
to saturate his mind with a mental vision of the
committal of the crime. It was not the first time,
of course, that he had taken a careful survey, but
he wished to reconstruct the scene, as he had
imagined it, more closely.</p>

<p>For this purpose he took up a position on the shore
just by the little garden gate. Then he
soliloquised:</p>

<p>“Yes—now suppose anyone in the house, or garden,
were on the lookout for Templeton’s
return—Wait a bit, though. Something might have
happened before then. It was, probably, only the
thought of robbery in the first place.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he exclaimed presently, “I believe
I’ve got it—it would account for the stick in the
dinghy and everything else. This way.</p>

<p>“Let us call the murderer A. Well, A has reason
to believe that Templeton has those diamonds, and
he doesn’t know that he has already given them to
Moss. He has seen Jim Webb go off to
Frattenbury—probably found out that he was staying the
night there. And he has seen Templeton go, too.
He could easily find out if he was expected back
late or not. Tom Gale knew it, Grayson knew it,
Jim Webb knew it—they talked it over in the inn.
And Mrs. Yates knew it—she told me she’d
remarked about it to others.</p>

<p>“Well, then, A, with this information, speculates
that Templeton might leave the diamonds on board.
Quite likely. It was a dark night and a lonely
walk. He determines to take a chance on this.
But he can’t do it till the coast is quite clear. That
wouldn’t be till after closing time—ten o’clock. He
waits about outside, probably in the garden, taking
his stick with him. He may have armed himself
with a knife—ah! that’s it, he took a tool of some
sort—very likely an old dagger, as the doctor pointed
out, to prise open any locks. Capital!</p>

<p>“What next? As he stood there waiting, he
lighted a cigar—being an inveterate smoker—from
force of habit. He would hear the men come out of
the inn at ten o’clock; he would hear Tom Gale
walk off along the quay, and then all would be quiet,
with a clear coast.</p>

<p>“He goes down to the shore now. The dinghy is
afloat. It’s much more simple to use her for his
purpose than to run a canoe down to the water—and
less noisy. He gets into the dinghy, laying his
walking-stick down in the stern—a natural action,
because the seat for the rower is well aft—pulls out
to the yacht, gets on board and makes the dinghy
fast.</p>

<p>“Then he lights the lamp. That’s all right, because
anyone seeing it would naturally conclude the
owner is aboard. People knew he was sleeping there
that night. And he begins to make his search.</p>

<p>“But Templeton comes back sooner than A
expected. A man doesn’t generally leave a house
where he’s dining so early. But we know Templeton
did. He sees the light on board, finds the dinghy
has gone, and wonders what is up. Possibly he
jumps to the conclusion that Jim Webb has come
back after all. A canoe is lying there handy; he
runs her down to the water and paddles aboard.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile A, still smoking his cigar from force
of habit, has burnt it down to the band; he flicks it
off, or it drops off by itself. Then he hears
Templeton coming aboard. He is caught in the act.</p>

<p>“He has the tool or dagger, whatever it is, in his
hand. Possibly his first impulse is to hide—behind
the table. But Templeton comes into the cabin,
and, for the moment, hesitates in astonishment.
The folding table is between them—that prevents
a struggle. And then the climax comes. A, either
desperate at being discovered or acting on a murderous
instinct for the sake of the jewels—he hadn’t
found them, and both lockers were open, as we
know—probably the former, reaches over the table and
aims a blow at the unlucky Templeton—a blow
which proves fatal.</p>

<p>“Then he probably pauses to think—he may even
take a look outside, or listen to hear if anyone is
about. He knows he’s risked his neck for the sake
of those diamonds. He’s a cool hand and calculates
there’s no <em>greater</em> risk—now the deed is done. So
he takes out of Templeton’s pockets his
wallet—anything he can find—he isn’t going to examine
them at the moment—he knows he must clear out
as quickly as possible. He puts his hand under the
body and feels the waistcoat pockets—they are
quite flat, so he doesn’t bother about them, little
knowing that he misses the only stone there is.</p>

<p>“His next move is to get back. Not the dinghy—the
canoe, of course. The dinghy might arouse
suspicion if found on the shore in the morning with
the canoe fast to the yacht. In his haste and
trepidation, he forgets the stick he has left in the
dinghy till afterwards. Probably he is indoors by
this time. He daren’t return that night. It’s too
big a risk. And he daren’t remove the stick the
next day; people are about from the beginning.
His only chance to recover that stick is to do
exactly what he did do—on Sunday night. There!
What do you think of that?”</p>

<p>He addressed the remark out loud to a solemn-looking
rook that had perched for a moment on a
post opposite to him.</p>

<p>And the rook flapped its wings and replied:</p>

<p>“Caw! Caw!”</p>

<p>And then flew away as if it was not a bit
impressed—which it ought to have been. For
Detective-Sergeant Colson’s reasoning was so very clear
and lucid that he felt it was going to hang a man
and give him promotion.</p>

<p>Colson, unabashed, by the irresponsive and somewhat
impertinent rook, went on with his construction
methods.</p>

<p>“When A had examined the contents of Templeton’s
pockets,” and he chuckled, “he was a little
disappointed, I fear. Of course, he burnt the lot.
We shall never find them, but we <em>shall</em> find A!”</p>

<p>Having arrived at this conclusion, to his great
satisfaction, Colson turned his thoughts to the other
object for which he had visited Marsh Quay that
day. He wanted to get, somehow, into Proctor’s
house, and that without anyone knowing about it.
He was quite prepared, if occasion brought the
necessity, to make a burglarious entry that night, for
which purpose he was minded to reconnoitre and
view possible means of entrance. There was
another method of course. He could ring the front-door
bell, boldly ask to see Proctor, and, finding
that he was out, beg to be allowed to remain until
he returned. The only hindrance to this procedure
was that he would arouse Proctor’s suspicions,
which he was not anxious to do. There was a
third way out of it, but rather risky. If he could
satisfy himself that the two domestics were out
of hearing in the kitchen at the back of the house,
he might be able to slip in now—and try to find
out what he wanted to know.</p>

<p>The way in which he really did enter the house
was entirely unforeseen by him. He went into the
garden, through the little green gate, and was
beginning carefully to observe how the windows of
the dining-room opened, when, out of the front
door, cigar in mouth, walked Mr. Proctor himself.
Afterwards he ascertained that Proctor had, after
walking half-way to Frattenbury, turned back and
let himself in at a door behind the house. The
nondescript-looking man who carried a fishing-rod,
but whose sport seemed to fail just at the time that
Proctor started for Frattenbury, told him this hours
later. At present he made an effort to conceal his
surprise and mentally said, “Damn!”</p>

<p>“Hallo, Mr. Colson,” said Proctor cheerily, “still
trying to find out about that nasty business, I
suppose! You were coming to see me?”</p>

<p>The detective had no resource but to reply in the
affirmative. This he did in a perfectly natural
manner.</p>

<p>“Well, come along in, then,” said the little man;
“it’s a bit chilly outside to-day.”</p>

<p>He led the way to his bachelor dining-room, and
gave the detective a chair. The latter had quite
recovered his composure; in fact, outwardly, he had
not shown that he had lost it.</p>

<p>“Just two or three things I should like to ask
you, Mr. Proctor. I know you’re on the jury, of
course, but I won’t interfere with your prerogatives.
I rather wish you’d have been summoned as a
witness instead.”</p>

<p>“That was the fault of the police,” said Proctor,
shrugging his shoulders. “Now, what can I tell you?
Stop. Have a cigar first. I can offer you a really
good smoke.”</p>

<p>“Cheek,” thought Colson.</p>

<p>Proctor went to a cupboard by the side of the
fire-place, took a bunch of keys from his pocket
and unlocked it. On a shelf were more than a
dozen boxes of cigars. Colson eyed them eagerly,
but was too far off to see them closely, and too wise
to give himself away by moving.</p>

<p>The little man carefully selected a box, shut the
cupboard and locked it, put the box in front of
Colson on the table and said:</p>

<p>“I think you’ll like these. Now, then, Mr.
Colson?”</p>

<p>The detective had taken out his pocket-book and
was apparently consulting it closely. In reality he
was inventing questions.</p>

<p>“We’re not at all satisfied, sir,” he said. “You’ve
got a good view of the estuary. You didn’t notice
any other strange craft besides the <i>Firefly</i> about at
the time the murder took place?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“It’s as well to be certain. I suppose a small
boat <em>could</em> have got up from lower down the estuary
that night?”</p>

<p>“Yes—certainly. The tide was flowing, you
know.”</p>

<p>“And she could have got back?”</p>

<p>“There was no wind. It would have been hard
rowing—unless whoever he was waited till the tide
turned.”</p>

<p>The detective asked several more questions and
spoilt three or four pages of his notebook by writing
down replies. Then the little man said:</p>

<p>“I’m just going to have tea. Won’t you have
some.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you very much, if it’s not troubling
you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all—if you don’t mind excusing me for
a few minutes. I’ve a letter to write—in my den.
I want to catch the only outgoing post we have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly, sir.”</p>

<p>“What a stroke of luck!” exclaimed the detective
when Proctor had left the room. “I should hardly
have believed it; but, of course, he doesn’t know.
He’s out of his reckoning—thinks because that band
was changed that we don’t suspect anything.”</p>

<p>For a minute Colson sat still, smoking his cigar.
Then, with a careful look around, he crossed on
tiptoe to the cupboard, took his skeleton keys from
his pocket, cautiously inserted first one, then another
in the keyhole and opened it.</p>

<p>Swiftly he ran his eye over the array of boxes.
Removing a pile in front, his face beamed as he
caught sight of an unfastened box in the back tier.
He recognised the label. Quickly he opened it, took
out a cigar and looked at the band.</p>

<p>“It’s the one!” he murmured.</p>

<p>He dropped the cigar in his pocket, closed and
locked the cupboard, resumed his seat, and was
innocently reading a newspaper he had picked off
the table, when Proctor returned, followed by his
maid bringing in the tea.</p>

<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting,” said the little man
genially. “Do you take sugar, Mr. Colson?”</p>

<p>They chatted on various topics, and when the
detective rose to go, Proctor accompanied him to
the door.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, Mr. Proctor.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Only too glad to have been of any
use to you. See you to-morrow at the adjourned
inquest, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Colson, “we shall meet at the inquest.
Good afternoon, sir.”</p>

<p>There was nothing further to detain him at Marsh
Quay, so he went back to Frattenbury and had a
long conversation with the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Excellent,” said the latter, ticking off items on
his fingers as he spoke. “The same brand of cigar,
and the cablegram from Cuba tells us they have
sent him these from time to time, and the firm in
London corroborate it.”</p>

<p>“And he’s been in Switzerland,” added Colson.</p>

<p>“And he’s been in Switzerland,” echoed the
superintendent. “It’s quite enough to go upon. I’ll make
out the deposition, and then—after the inquest.”</p>

<p>“After the inquest,” the detective said with a
chuckle. “I wonder what sort of a verdict the
foreman will persuade the jury to return!”</p>

<p>“Wilful murder—against some person unknown,”
replied the superintendent sardonically.</p>

<p>“But it won’t be a true verdict,” said Colson with
decision.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI. <br> Mr. Proctor Upsets Matters</h2>

<p>The coroner, in re-opening the inquiry, intimated
that only one witness of any importance would be
heard, and that, with the full consent of the police,
who would not, he understood, ask for a further
adjournment, the jury would be called upon to record
their verdict that afternoon.</p>

<p>The first witness called was a postman who gave
evidence that he had seen the deceased coming out
of the Cathedral precincts at Frattenbury between
half-past eight and nine on the Saturday evening.
He, the witness, was standing outside the post office,
opposite the gateway into the Close, where there
was an electric lamp.</p>

<p>“Why did you not tell us this at the
commencement of the inquiry?” asked the coroner.</p>

<p>“Because it was only through a portrait of the
deceased, published in a newspaper afterwards, that
I remembered his face, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Did you see which way he went when
he came out of the Close?”</p>

<p>“Up the street, towards the Cross, sir.”</p>

<p>“That was all you noticed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, nothing more.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Isaac Moss was called next. He was terribly
nervous, and gave his evidence in such a low tone
of voice that the coroner had frequently to ask him
to speak up. Bit by bit the story he had told the
superintendent and Colson was painfully dragged
from him. The jury listened attentively, and
evidently one or two of them were not much struck
with his veracity. The coroner then questioned him.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you inform the police at the time?”</p>

<p>“I was too much frightened.”</p>

<p>“You know that you put yourself in a very serious
position, Mr. Moss?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that. I regret it very much now.”</p>

<p>“You say that it was after half-past twelve when
you crossed the estuary?”</p>

<p>“It was; it struck one just after I had left the
yacht.”</p>

<p>“Have you anyone who can corroborate your
statement that you had not left your house before?”</p>

<p>“My wife is here, and my housekeeper, who
brought in some hot water for my whisky just before
eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“We will hear them—for your sake,” said the
coroner. “But in any case, it is my duty to
reprimand you seriously for your foolish behaviour.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Moss and the housekeeper having given brief
evidence, a juror said:</p>

<p>“May I ask you a question, sir?”</p>

<p>The coroner nodded.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a fact that the doctor who examined
the body told us last time that the murder <em>might</em>
have been committed after midnight?”</p>

<p>“That is so,” replied the coroner, looking round.
“The doctor is here. Would you like him to repeat
his statement?”</p>

<p>“If you please, sir.”</p>

<p>And the doctor said:</p>

<p>“Yes. I certainly stated that the murder might
have been committed after twelve, but not long after.
The probability is that it took place before that
hour. Rigor mortis was palpably developed.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the coroner. “Are there any
more witnesses?”</p>

<p>There was only Joe Thatcher, who gave brief
evidence as to seeing Moss board the yacht, and gave
no little amusement at his indignantly assumed
innocence when questioned as to his doings that night.
The police were careful to state that he had come
forward voluntarily.</p>

<p>The coroner summed up briefly, not too greatly
in favour of Moss, and directed the jury to find their
verdict.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to retire, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the juryman who had spoken
before.</p>

<p>The jury went into another room, and there was
a little buzz of conversation. The coroner did not
join in it. He was absorbed in his notes. Anthony
Crosby, who was seated next to the Chief Constable,
said to the latter:</p>

<p>“I should like to call at the police station for a
short conversation. There’s something I want to
see.”</p>

<p>“You shall,” said the Chief Constable. “I’ll motor
you back in my car. Norton and Colson are coming
in the other. We shall probably have some interesting
information to give you by that time,” he went
on grimly. “There are going to be developments.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>Major Renshaw nodded.</p>

<p>“You’ll see,” he said. “I hope the jury won’t be
long—though it really doesn’t matter what verdict
they bring in. I say—you won’t mind waiting a
few minutes before we start back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no.”</p>

<p>But the jury still remained out of the room. Presently
a note was handed in and given to the coroner,
who opened it, read it and then said:</p>

<p>“The jury wish to know whether the police are
satisfied with the evidence of Mr. Moss.”</p>

<p>He glanced at Moss as he spoke. The Jew’s face
paled. The superintendent whispered a word or two
to him, and the Chief Constable said to the coroner:</p>

<p>“You may tell the jury, sir, that we are perfectly
satisfied. We have nothing to bring against Mr.
Moss.”</p>

<p>Moss gave a sigh of relief, and the coroner
scribbled a note to the jury. In about ten minutes’
time that body filed in, one or two of them looking
very heated.</p>

<p>The coroner addressed the foreman.</p>

<p>“Are you all agreed on your verdict?”</p>

<p>“We are, sir.”</p>

<p>“And it is?”</p>

<p>“Wilful murder against some person or persons
unknown.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I agree with your finding. The
inquiry is closed.”</p>

<p>After a few brief formalities the assembly broke
up. Major Renshaw, the superintendent and Colson
detached themselves from the rest and went
outside the inn. Presently Proctor came out and
was walking across to his house opposite, when the
Chief Constable spoke to him.</p>

<p>“We have a matter of business with you that is
best discussed in private, Mr. Proctor. May we
come over to your house?”</p>

<p>He looked at the three men steadily, smiled slightly
and said:</p>

<p>“By all means, Major. Come along.” As they
walked across he said to them, in quite a matter-of-fact
way: “I had quite a little trouble with that
jury. Two or three of them were bent on returning
a verdict against the unfortunate Moss. Of course,
he didn’t do it, but it wasn’t till we had the note
from the coroner that they fell in with the rest.”</p>

<p>“No—he didn’t do it,” said the Major dryly.</p>

<p>The little man was opening his front door. He
gave the Chief Constable a quick glance, pursed up
his mouth and smiled. He led the way into the
dining-room. The three policemen were silent. Then
Major Renshaw addressed him, his face very grave.</p>

<p>“Mr. Proctor, I fear I have a most unpleasant
du——”</p>

<p>“I know exactly what you’re going to do,” broke
in the little man before the other could go on.
“You’re going to arrest me for the murder of
Reginald Templeton, and then warn me that anything
I say may be used as evidence against me. Isn’t
that so?”</p>

<p>For a moment or two Major Renshaw was silent
with astonishment. The superintendent gave a low
whistle. Colson exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Great Scott!”</p>

<p>The Chief Constable recovered himself.</p>

<p>“You are right, Mr. Proctor,” he said sternly.
“Take care what you say, sir!” For Proctor was
again about to speak, and he did speak, in spite
of the warning.</p>

<p>“One minute, Major—I beg of you, one minute.
Oh, you may make use of anything I say, and
welcome. But it’s for your own sake. I’ve a strong
respect for the police. I knew you were going to
arrest me. I expected it before this.”</p>

<p>“You are only doing yourself harm, sir!” thundered
the Chief Constable in his best military style.
“I warn you.”</p>

<p>“And I warn you, Major,” said the imperturbable
little man, pointing at the Chief Constable, “if you
once formally arrest me, I shall remain silent until
I’m before the magistrates. And then you and your
police will be a laughing-stock. And I shan’t even
have to employ a lawyer. It’s true, Major.”</p>

<p>The astonished Chief Constable hesitated. He
turned to the superintendent, but the latter only
shook his head in bewilderment. Colson was hard
at work biting his finger-nails. It was an
unprecedented scene.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir?” asked the Chief
Constable, hesitating a little.</p>

<p>“This, Major. I’ll go with you to Frattenbury
with pleasure, and you can detain me till you’re
satisfied. I’ll explain everything, and you may
arrest me if you like when I’ve finished—though you
won’t. But if you do it now—I’m dumb.”</p>

<p>The Major took the superintendent to the other
end of the room and held a whispered conversation
with him. Proctor calmly lighted a cigar and handed
his case to Colson. The latter refused it with a
shake of the head, and the little man only grinned
exasperatingly at him.</p>

<p>Then the Major came forward.</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Proctor,” he said stiffly, “we will
take you into Frattenbury, please, on detention for
the present. But I warn you that there are ugly
facts against you.”</p>

<p>“I know there are,” said Proctor coolly, “and
I was a bit glad to hear that Jew’s evidence just
now—and to hear the doctor repeat his. But I’ve
nothing to be afraid of. I’m quite ready, Major.”</p>

<p>It was when they arrived at the police station
that Proctor explained. Crosby was present. The
Chief Constable had told him something about the
affair as he motored him into Frattenbury.</p>

<p>“You may as well hear what he’s got to say,”
he said.</p>

<p>Proctor was accommodated with a chair in the
private office at the police station. The
superintendent sat at his desk, pen in hand. Major
Renshaw began:</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Proctor, we will hear what you have
to say, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Major. Will you kindly send for Mr.
Stephen Merrifield? His place of business is just
opposite here.”</p>

<p>“The corn merchant?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. You’ll take his word, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Without replying the Major sent for Merrifield.
The little man went on:</p>

<p>“When I first had a notion that you were
suspecting me, Mr. Colson,” he said, addressing the
detective, “was that Monday morning when I recovered
my canoe. My nephew told me what you had asked
him about disturbing me in the dark hours, and so
on, and I knew you wouldn’t have said it without
some reason. Also, I saw you were interested in
that canoe being taken away—though for the life
of me I can’t guess why. I put two and two together
and came to the conclusion that you were trying
to find out whether I had run off with my own
canoe, and left it where it was pretty sure Phil
would find it in the morning. And it puzzled me.
But it also put me on my guard.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Well, then came the inquest. When the doctor
said that death might have occurred after midnight,
I was just a little perturbed—you’ll see why presently.
I suppose I was the nearest person to
Templeton—his yacht lay just opposite my house. And
when Canon Fittleworth handed in that cigar band,
for the moment I was fairly alarmed.”</p>

<p>“That’s why you cha——” began the superintendent,
but Colson stopped him with a warning
gesticulation.</p>

<p>“Eh?” asked Proctor.</p>

<p>“Oh—nothing,” said the superintendent. “Go on,
please.”</p>

<p>“Although the Canon stated the cigar was one of
his own special brand, I knew I had the same brand
in my house. Why,” he said to the superintendent,
“you smoked one yourself—on the Sunday morning,
and remarked how good it was. Don’t you
remember?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said the superintendent, “but I never
noticed the band.”</p>

<p>“I was wondering if you had,” went on Proctor,
with a smile. “Then I wanted the coroner to put
a question to the Canon, but he wouldn’t allow it.”</p>

<p>“What was the question?” asked Major Renshaw.</p>

<p>“I only wanted him to ask whether the Canon
could remember to whom he gave any of his cigars.
But I concluded afterwards that you would examine
the reverend gentleman pretty closely on that point.
I gather you <em>did</em>, and came to the conclusion that it
wasn’t in that quarter that you had to make your
investigations.”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” said Major Renshaw, “knowing
you possessed the same brand of cigar, and in order
to put us off your track——”</p>

<p>But he was interrupted. A newcomer was shown
in, a portly man with grey moustache and short
beard and a round, jovial face.</p>

<p>“Oh, good afternoon, Mr. Merrifield,” said the
Chief Constable. “Do you mind waiting just a
minute?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.” He looked round the room,
nodded affably to Mr. Proctor, and took the seat
which Colson offered him.</p>

<p>“Go on, Mr. Proctor.”</p>

<p>“Where was I? Oh, yes—I know. Well, very
soon after the inquest, I found I was being watched.
That wasn’t much of a fisherman you sent over to
Marsh Quay, Mr. Colson! Oh, yes, I knew. When
I went over to Portsmouth last Monday on business,
and found that this fisherman travelled by the same
train there and back, I was pretty certain.”</p>

<p>“We were bound to keep an eye on you,” said
the superintendent.</p>

<p>“I don’t dispute it. But I’m afraid, as an innocent
man, I resented it. My way of looking at it
was that I’d have liked you to come and have the
whole thing out with me. Of course, you know
your own methods best. Anyhow, yesterday I set a
little trap for you, Mr. Colson. I hope you’ll
forgive me.”</p>

<p>“A trap?” said Colson.</p>

<p>“In this way. I saw you lounging about at Marsh
Quay. I imagined you wanted me out of the way,
so I started for Frattenbury. But I very soon
retraced my steps, and let myself in at the back door.
Out of the window I saw you in my garden. I
came out and asked you in. Then I made an excuse
for leaving you in my dining-room, which was what
you wanted, I imagine.”</p>

<p>Colson looked very black, especially as the
superintendent gave him an amused glance.</p>

<p>“Well,” went on the little man, “while you were
examining the contents of my cigar cupboard I was
watching you from outside, through the window. I
was behind the laurel bush opposite it! You took
one of those cigars. I’d counted ’em first. So I
guessed you were going to arrest me pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well, so far as it goes,” said the
Chief Constable, “but it’s only your own story. It
doesn’t in any way clear you.”</p>

<p>“I know. But you’ll soon be satisfied. In the
first place, the evidence of Isaac Moss—which you
allow—proves that the crime was committed before
one o’clock on the Sunday morning, eh, Major?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I concede that.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now will you hear what Mr.
Merrifield has to say?”</p>

<p>Merrifield was just going to speak, but the Chief
Constable held up his hand for silence.</p>

<p>“What do you wish me to ask him, Mr. Proctor?”</p>

<p>“Where I was on the Saturday night.”</p>

<p>“If you know that, Mr. Merrifield, perhaps you’ll
tell us?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I will. You don’t mean to say
you’ve been thinking my friend here committed a
murder? Why, he wouldn’t hurt a fly! It’s all
right, Major Renshaw. Mr. Proctor had supper in
my house on the Saturday night in question. He
and my wife and a friend staying with us played
bridge afterwards, and I’m ashamed to say we went
on into Sunday morning. It was close on one o’clock
when we finished the last rubber. It’s a lonesome
sort of a walk to Marsh Quay, so I offered to run
Mr. Proctor back in my car—and did.”</p>

<p>The superintendent brought his hand down on
the desk.</p>

<p>“That explains what Joe Thatcher said about a
motor!” he exclaimed. “Well, Mr. Merrifield?”</p>

<p>“That’s all there is, Superintendent. It didn’t take
long to get down there. I stopped the car opposite
his gate, and he asked me to go in. I went, and
I don’t deny that we had a final whisky and soda
to wind up the evening. It was exactly half-past one
by the clock on his mantelpiece when I went out
and came back to Frattenbury. I hope that
satisfies you?”</p>

<p>“Am I to be set at liberty?” asked Proctor dryly.</p>

<p>The little man looked so quaint, with his bald,
egg-shaped head, that Major Renshaw could scarcely
restrain a smile.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing else we can do with you, Mr.
Proctor. But I wish you had told us all this before.”</p>

<p>Proctor drew himself up with an air of injured
dignity.</p>

<p>“I objected to being shadowed,” he said. “It put
my back up. You’ll confess it wouldn’t have been
wise to have arrested me?”</p>

<p>“Ah, don’t say any more, Mr. Proctor. We’ll try
to forgive you this time. I’m sorry we’ve upset
you, but we’re quite satisfied now.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want me any longer, Major?” asked
Merrifield. “All right. Come along, Proctor, old
chap. You’ll be wanting something to pick you up
after all this, and I’ve got it at my house.”</p>

<p>When they were gone the Major, the superintendent
and Anthony Crosby looked at each other for
a moment or two, and then simultaneously burst
into a roar of laughter. But Colson did not join
in. His face was as black as a thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Crosby to the Chief Constable,
“you’ll admit he fairly had you, Major Renshaw?
Aren’t you glad you didn’t arrest him?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said the Major grimly. “I confess it.
Conceited little beggar! I’m glad he had a fright,
though. He did, you know, or he wouldn’t have
changed that cigar band at the inquest.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the lawyer reflectively, “it was only
natural, I suppose. A sudden impulse, you know.
I can quite understand that even an innocent man,
suddenly confronted with such a damning bit of
evidence against him, should succumb to the
temptation and take advantage of his peculiar
opportunity. How do you think he did it?”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Colson gloomily—“there were
several bands from Grayson’s cigars lying in the
grate. He picked up one of those. I remembered
afterwards—I could almost swear I saw him do it.
That was what put us on to Grayson. We’ve taken
all three suspects—and now there’s an end of them.”</p>

<p>The Chief Constable, beneath his somewhat stiff
military bearing, was a kindly man. He put his
hand on the detective’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come, Colson,” he said, “you couldn’t help it.
It’s a bit of a set-back, I know; but after all, it’s
cleared the ground.”</p>

<p>Colson looked up, and blurted out what was on his
mind:</p>

<p>“Are you going to call in Scotland Yard, sir?”</p>

<p>The superintendent looked hard at Major Renshaw,
but said nothing. The Major reflected. Then
he said:</p>

<p>“You shall have another week, Colson. Get on
with the job and see what you can do.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” broke in Crosby. “I’ve got a train
to catch, and I’d almost forgotten—I want to have
a look at that blotting-pad. I’ve got the copy, but
I want to see the original.”</p>

<p>The superintendent produced it. The lawyer took
it to the light, pulled a big magnifying glass out
a of his pocket, and examined it carefully.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed, “my guess is correct. Who
made the copy?”</p>

<p>“I did,” said Colson.</p>

<p>“You’ve left out something. Look here—through
my glass. Take that word ICES. Do you notice,
first of all, that there’s a slightly bigger space
between the E and the S than there is between the
other letters?”</p>

<p>“Y-e-s,” admitted the detective.</p>

<p>“And can you see, with the help of the glass,
anything between the E and the S?”</p>

<p>“There’s the faintest little mark—not between
them, but just over the space.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And that’s a comma—an apostrophe.
It isn’t EZRA’S ICES at all; it’s EZRA, then three
spaces, then ICE’S. The first space represents the
division between the two words, so we want two
letters before ICES. EZRA being a Christian name,
it follows in all probability that the other is a
surname. Now, what surnames of five letters end in
ICE? Take the supposition first, that the second
missing letter is a vowel. You might have ‘Daice,’
‘Laice,’ ‘Maice’—they don’t look likely, eh?—or
‘Reice,’ or ‘Joice’—generally spelt with a ‘y’—or
‘Juice.’ I’ve tried every consonant as a first letter.
Take consonants as the second letter, and put any
vowels as the first, and you don’t make much either.
But there are just two fairly common surnames
that you can get by using two consonants as the
first two letters, and they are ‘PRICE’ and ‘GRICE.’
If I were working on this clue, I should go for Ezra
Price or Ezra Grice.”</p>

<p>The three men followed him closely.</p>

<p>“Now take the next two words, connected by
the ‘&amp;.’ I’ve only time to give you a hasty
deduction. There are two words which would agree with
the spaces in the first word—‘profession’ or
‘confession.’ ‘ROO’ is at the end of the line of writing.
It has obviously only one letter in front of it, and
one, or perhaps two, after it. I’ve tried every
consonant as the first letter—with only one result. And
I make the word ‘PROOF’ or ‘PROOFS.’ There
you are—‘Ezra Price’s (or Grice’s) confession and
proof.’ It looks interesting. Whoever it was to
whom Templeton wrote that letter, he knew
something about Ezra Price—or Grice.”</p>

<p>“That looks feasible,” said the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” went on the lawyer.
“As Templeton’s representative—he’s made me his
executor—I’ll put an advertisement in the papers
asking anyone who heard from him since he returned
to England to communicate with me and tell
me the nature of the correspondence. If a reference
to this letter turns up, well and good. If not, it’s
a process of elimination, and we can assume that
the recipient doesn’t want to give it away. Let me
do this—then there won’t be a question of the police
having anything to do with it. I must run; I’ve
only just time to catch my train. I’ll let you know
the result.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII. <br> New Theories</h2>

<p>“You’ve just got to solve it, Bob, and you’re
going to solve it,” said Mrs. Colson that night
to her somewhat disconsolate husband. “And that
for two reasons: first because such a wicked wretch
ought to be punished, and secondly because you’re
my dear hubby. So there now!”</p>

<p>She gave him a kiss and took a chair by him in
front of the fire.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to begin all over again,” he said moodily.</p>

<p>“Of course you have, dear. And what of that?
You’ve ever so much better a chance now you’ve
cleared away the hindrances. Now, let’s begin.
We’re going to talk it over, Bob, and your wife is
going to help you with her big brain—oh, ever so
much!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got a week’s probation, so to speak,”
he said, “and I’ll jolly well try. All right, we’ll
talk it over. You shall begin.”</p>

<p>She put her elbows on her knees and rested her
chin on her hands.</p>

<p>“First of all, then, let’s get rid of all the old
theories. You’ve gone on the supposition that the
murderer was near the spot all the time, haven’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, it looked like it.”</p>

<p>“I know. Now, is there anyone else living there
whom you could suspect?”</p>

<p>By this time he had a mental category of every
man, woman and child at Marsh Quay. He turned
it over.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “only boatmen and labourers—and
a retired parson who lives near, a very nice
chap. Rule him out.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Then we’ll begin by assuming that
the murderer came from a distance.”</p>

<p>“Frattenbury?”</p>

<p>“Possibly. We’ll get back to that later on. Next
point—the motive. Up to now you’ve thought it
was to get the diamonds. Let’s throw that out;
I’m sick of the diamonds.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t be if you had ’em, dear. All right,
then the diamonds shall go. Let’s say he was after
something else.”</p>

<p>“And that something else was Templeton’s life.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“Why not? There is such a thing as premeditated
murder, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“You may be right,” he assented, “or Templeton
may have been possessed of something else——”</p>

<p>“That was worth taking his life to get! Remember
<em>that</em>!” she said, lifting a warning finger.
“People don’t generally commit murder for the sake
of killing anyone, you know. Now, let’s get on.
Let’s try and picture how it was done.”</p>

<p>“I told you last night how I’d worked it out, dear.
The murderer went on board in the dinghy——”</p>

<p>“Stop, stop. Now remember, Bob, that’s an old
theory. Everything we discuss to-night must be a
new idea. That theory presupposes that the murderer
was on the yacht first. Put it away. Tell me
what other alternatives were there? I’m out of my
depth here.”</p>

<p>He thought carefully for a few minutes and
replied:</p>

<p>“Only three, as far as I can see. First, some
boat from outside came in. Not likely, because one
of the canoes was found unfastened in the morning.
Mrs. Yates told me this. Secondly, that the
murderer went out to the yacht in the canoe after
Templeton had returned. Also unlikely, because he
would scarcely have transferred his stick to the
dinghy. Thirdly, that hardly seems probable.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s worth consideration, Bob. You’ve gone,
too much, on probabilities. Let’s have this ‘thirdly,’
please.”</p>

<p>She had never heard of the theologian’s famous
dictum, “<i>Credo, quia incredibile est</i>,” but it was the
same line of reasoning.</p>

<p>“It’s this, then. Templeton himself rowed the
murderer out in the dinghy, the latter sitting in the
stern and laying his stick down as he sat. They
both went on board and the murder was committed.
Now comes the improbable part. The murderer
rowed back to shore in the dinghy, ran the canoe
down to the water, paddled back towing the dinghy,
made the latter fast again to the yacht, and finally
returned in the canoe, dragging her up again, but
forgetting to fasten her painter to the post as
before.”</p>

<p>For some minutes Mrs. Colson gazed steadily into
the fire in silence. Colson refilled and lighted his
pipe, and waited. Then she said:</p>

<p>“I see. But he might have had a very artful
object in doing this. If he went on board with
Templeton, and he didn’t live at Marsh Quay, he
must have met him somewhere else first—and gone
with him. Well, if he’d only landed in the dinghy
and left it on the shore, it would have been a clear
proof that Templeton had taken him on board—and
if, by any chance, they had happened to be
seen by anybody <em>first</em>—he would naturally have been
suspected. His very best plan would be to leave the
dinghy fast to the yacht, and he could only have
done so in the way you say.”</p>

<p>Colson smoked for a moment or two.</p>

<p>“It was taking a big risk—risking time for getting
clear away.”</p>

<p>“It was worth it, Bob. Would it make much
noise—getting the canoe down to the water?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; it was lying on a patch of grass—the
grass grows right down to the water’s edge, you
know—and if the tide wasn’t quite up—and it
wasn’t—there would be soft, sandy mud just there
between the green and the water’s edge. The stony
part of the beach is nearer the quay. And the canoe
is almost light enough for a strong man to carry.
No, there needn’t have been any noise.”</p>

<p>She looked at him and smiled.</p>

<p>“We’re getting on, then.”</p>

<p>“There’s another point in favour—ah, you’ve
scored again, dear—I was just going to say that it
would make things look so improbable.”</p>

<p>They both laughed heartily. Suddenly a little
shadow came over her face.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she said, “he’s a very clever
man—I’m sure he is. Do take care, Bob.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“When you match your wits against a man like
this you have to be careful. And he probably knows
you’re doing it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he said; “he’s put me down as
a blunderer long ago. Remember, he knows nothing
about the walking-stick or the cigar. He can’t
suspect.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let him, then. Well—let’s follow it up.
He walked out with Templeton from Frattenbury.”</p>

<p>“What makes you say that?”</p>

<p>“It don’t know—just because I’m a woman, and
you can’t expect me always to reason things out
and say why. But I am going to think now—don’t
speak, Bob.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence. She suddenly turned
towards him, gripped his hand, and said:</p>

<p>“Bob!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Suppose you’re mistaken again! And by our
plan you <em>are</em>, you know—because we’re trying
everything fresh.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what——”</p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt, dear. Suppose those stick marks
were not made by Templeton going <em>into</em> Frattenbury,
but were made by the murderer walking out
with him.”</p>

<p>“But that’s not likely. They were on the right
side of the path coming in, and——”</p>

<p>“You silly dear! But they were on the left-hand
side going out. Bob—look out for a left-handed
man!”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he exclaimed, “there’s something in
that. In that case Templeton <em>carried</em> his stick in
with him and didn’t put it to the ground.”</p>

<p>“Was he short or tall?”</p>

<p>“Medium—inclined to be short.”</p>

<p>She clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“That’s it, dear!—look out for a tall, left-handed
man. If only you could find out whether
Templeton <em>carried</em> his stick—for certain——?”</p>

<p>“Stop—stop a bit!”</p>

<p>He got up and paced the little room, smoking
furiously.</p>

<p>“I know!” he exclaimed, stopping suddenly.
“There <em>is</em> a chance of finding out. If only he
remembers.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“I won’t tell you till I’m certain. Go on, dear.”</p>

<p>She waited a little.</p>

<p>“I can’t think of any more, Bob. Is there anything
else <em>new</em>—anything, I mean, that you haven’t
followed up yet?”</p>

<p>“There’s that blotting-pad,” he said. “I don’t
know that there’s anything in it——”</p>

<p>“Then for goodness’ sake follow it up, Bob.
That’s what I <em>mean</em>.”</p>

<p>“Well, the lawyer from London, Mr. Crosby, gave
me a hint about that. I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>He produced his copy and showed her what
Crosby had pointed out.</p>

<p>“Ezra Price—or Ezra Grice,” she said, “let’s
take it then. How would you work on it?”</p>

<p>After a bit he said:</p>

<p>“Well, the only way is this. If we take the
letter at all as part of the business, and fit it in
with these new theories, we must assume that the
man to whom it was written knows something about
Ezra. And we are assuming that this man lives—or
was at the time—in Frattenbury. But I’ve never
heard the name of Ezra—Price or Grice.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve only lived in Frattenbury six years,
dear. Of course you can’t expect to have heard of
him. Can’t you find out if he was ever here, or if
anyone knew anything about him?”</p>

<p>“I might,” he said. “Mr. Buckland, the chemist,
has got a pretty fair memory of all kinds of people.
He’s lived here all his life. We often go to him
when we want to find out the past of anyone. I’ll
try him to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She jumped up from her seat. “I’m going to
get supper now, Bob. We’ve done enough for to-night.
Yes, we’ll have it early because you’re going
to be a nice old dear and take me to the pictures,
and forget there was ever a murder at Marsh Quay
and a detective who did his best, and then—even
though he was a brainy, oh, ever so clever a man,
and wanted to be an inspector one day—had to take
his little wife’s advice, and pay for it in
kisses—oh—that’s enough, Bob—it wasn’t worth <em>all</em> those.”</p>

<p>“The overplus were for yourself,” said Colson,
“and I still owe a heavy bill.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Next day Colson, in a far more cheery mood, after
seeing Constable Gadsden for a moment and
consulting the latter’s ponderous and well-thumbed
notebook, cycled once more on the now familiar road
to Marsh Quay, where he inquired at a cottage for
one George Simmonds, and was told by his wife that
he was helping to load the <i>Lucy</i>, which had returned
once more for a cargo of gravel. He very soon
found the man and said to him:</p>

<p>“Have you got a good memory, Simmonds?”</p>

<p>“I remember the last man as stood me a pint o’
beer, guv’nor,” was the response.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you’ll have the same cause to
remember me when we’ve finished. Anyhow, on the
morning when the murder was discovered here you
told the police-constable you’d met Mr. Templeton
the previous afternoon—going into Frattenbury.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, guv’nor. ’Twarn’t he as give me
that pint, though.”</p>

<p>“Quite so. Now, let’s see if you can tell me how
he was dressed.”</p>

<p>The man described him pretty accurately.</p>

<p>“Good,” said the detective; “had he got anything
in his hand?”</p>

<p>The man thought a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes—a stick. I didn’t take no notice on it,
though—I can’t say what ’twas like.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that. Was he carrying it or walking
with it?”</p>

<p>Simmonds grinned sheepishly and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Colson, picking up a bit of
stick that was lying on the ground, “this is what I
mean. Did he hold it by the handle and stick it in
the ground like <em>this</em>—or carry it, by the middle,
<em>so</em>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can easily tell ’ee that. He had it by the
middle, same as you have now.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure?”</p>

<p>“Sartain, guv’nor—I see him a-doin’ on it.”</p>

<p>“All right. Here you are then.”</p>

<p>The man spat on the coin, pocketed it, and
grinned.</p>

<p>“Thankee, guv’nor—that’s good for a quart, that
is. I shan’t forget <em>you</em>—if anyone wants to pay
me for rememberin’.”</p>

<p>“<em>One</em> to the wife,” said Colson as he sped back to
Frattenbury. “Now for Mr. Buckland.”</p>

<p>He found the chemist standing behind his counter,
a grave-looking man with wrinkled forehead and
a big walrus moustache.</p>

<p>“I want a bit of information, if you can give it to
me, Mr. Buckland.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Come inside, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Inside” was a tiny, dingy parlour at the back
of the shop. The chemist closed the door.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Colson?”</p>

<p>“You know most people who’ve lived here the
last forty years, Mr. Buckland. Did you ever hear
of anyone by the name of Ezra Price?”</p>

<p>“Ezra Price,” reflected the chemist—“the name
has a sort of familiar sound. There aren’t many
Ezras about, either. Ezra <em>Price</em>—it—somehow
doesn’t seem right—yet——”</p>

<p>“Ezra Grice, then.”</p>

<p>“Ezra <em>Grice</em>—that seems more like it—yes—now
let me think—it must have been a long time
ago——Grice—yes—I know now. He was a lawyer’s
clerk—or something—I’m beginning to remember—a bad
lot, wasn’t he? I’m not sure. Stop, though—I
know who’d tell you more about him. He was in
Mr. Norwood’s office—so far as I can recollect.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Norwood?”</p>

<p>“That’s it—you’d better try him.”</p>

<p>“All right, I will,” said the detective. “Thank
you very much for putting me on the scent.”</p>

<p>“Not at all.”</p>

<p>As he passed down the street, however, he saw
Mr. Norwood hurrying into the Magistrates’ Court
which was then sitting. So, wishing to see him at
leisure, he called at the lawyer’s house in the
evening, when he felt pretty certain of finding him at
home. He waited in the hall while the maid tapped
at the dining-room door and announced him.</p>

<p>“Oh—show him in here,” came a voice from the
room.</p>

<p>Francis Norwood had just finished his solitary
dinner and was draining his glass of port.</p>

<p>“Good evening, sergeant,” he said in his formal
manner. “Something you want to see me about?
Another inquest?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. But I thought you could give me some
information—I was told you could. I understand
there was a young man employed by you—many
years ago.”</p>

<p>“I’ve employed a number of young men in my
time—some of them to my cost! What was his
name?”</p>

<p>“Ezra Grice, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh—yes, I think I remember him. Of
course I do.”</p>

<p>He reached for the decanter, noticed it was empty,
and said:</p>

<p>“I was going to offer you a glass of port, sergeant,
but I see there’s none left. Will you have a whisky
and soda?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>Francis Norwood rose stiffly from his chair and
opened the door of a sideboard just behind him.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” he exclaimed, “there isn’t any
decanter—oh, here’s a bottle.”</p>

<p>He took a corkscrew from a drawer and drew the
cork from the bottle, Colson looking on in silence.
Then he produced two tumblers and poured whisky
into both, filling them up with soda.</p>

<p>One he gave to Colson, and the other he kept for
himself. First taking a drink from it, he said:</p>

<p>“Well, now, I dare say I can help you. May I
ask what you want to know about Ezra Grice?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh—yes. Anything you can tell me, sir.”</p>

<p>“And why?”</p>

<p>“It concerns a case we have in hand, sir.”</p>

<p>Colson never gave anything away if he could help
it.</p>

<p>“I see. Well, it’s years ago now—quite twenty
years, sergeant. Grice was my clerk. He must have
been three or four and twenty at the time. A sharp
young fellow. His parents kept a little bookshop
in the North Street—they’re both dead now. Do
you want to know why he left me?”</p>

<p>“If you please, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say I had to dismiss him; I ought
to have prosecuted him, but I didn’t. He robbed
me, sergeant. For the sake of his parents, who were
respectable people and implored me not to put him
in prison, I spared him. He left Frattenbury at
once, and, so far as I know, he’s never entered it
again.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where he went?”</p>

<p>“I believe he emigrated—the best thing he could
do. But, mind you, I’ve never seen him since.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard of him, sir?”</p>

<p>“In a way. A rumour reached me some time
ago that he was dead, but I can’t vouch for it.”</p>

<p>“We should like to get hold of him if he’s alive,”
said the detective, after a short pause.</p>

<p>The lawyer took a sip at his glass, and replied in
his dry, precise manner:</p>

<p>“If you really want him, sergeant, I’d do anything
I can in the matter. Why not advertise for
him? You’re quite welcome to use my name in an
advertisement—unless you think if he <em>is</em> alive and
sees the advertisement it might frighten him? But,
pray do what you think best. If you like to step
into my office in the morning I can show you his
record—and I may have notes about him you might
like to see. Any way, I’m quite at your service.”</p>

<p>“That is very kind of you, sir. We may try
advertising.”</p>

<p>“Do—by all means. I hope it may be successful—if
you want him. Good evening, sergeant. Come
to my office in the morning, then.”</p>

<p>When the detective had departed, the lawyer
lighted a cigarette and slowly finished his whisky;
then he took up a newspaper he had laid down on
the table when Colson came in, and was studying
it when the maid announced:</p>

<p>“Dr. Hazell, sir.”</p>

<p>“Come in, Hazell.”</p>

<p>The little doctor entered. He was a bit flustered.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Norwood. I haven’t come in to
stay. I say, you remember when I was dining here
some nights back Sir Peter told us about ‘Virginian
Reefs’—said they were good, don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I hope to the Lord you won’t get any,
Norwood.”</p>

<p>The lawyer laughed his dry, short laugh.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I was fool enough to buy five hundred of ’em,
and they’re down to fifteen shillings in to-night’s
paper.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’ll pick up,” said Norwood. “Sir
Peter seemed to think so.”</p>

<p>“The worst of it is there’s another report. Not
the one Sir Peter spoke of, you know—and it’s a
bad one. I can’t afford to lose the money—I shall
have to cut the loss. I’ve been a damn fool,
Norwood.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said the lawyer, “but I’m afraid
you have.”</p>

<p>“Well, at all events, I thought I’d warn you.
Good night. I’ve got a patient to see.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Doctor. Thank you very much.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Meanwhile, Colson was making his way to the police
station, which was at the bottom of the South
Street. He seemed a little lost in thought, for he
nearly ran into Canon Fittleworth, who was coming
out of the Close to post a letter.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the Canon, recognising him, “have
you got five minutes to spare? Thanks. If you
don’t mind coming round to my house a minute,
I’ve got that list ready.”</p>

<p>“I should like to have it very much, sir,” replied
Colson.</p>

<p>The worthy Canon prided himself on his accuracy
of detail. In his study he produced his list.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Fittleworth and my daughter have
carefully refreshed my memory,” he said. “Half a
dozen times we’ve gone over all the men who dined
here—or smoked with me—since I received that
box of cigars. Here’s the list. I hope it won’t help
you in one way—I mean, they are all my intimate
friends!”</p>

<p>He handed a paper to the detective, who ran
his eye down the names eagerly. They were all
prominent Frattenbury gentlemen—Dr. Hazell, Sir
Peter Birchnall, Cathedral dignitaries, and so on.</p>

<p>“I suppose you can’t remember if anyone here
took away a cigar without smoking it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can,” said the Canon. “One of them
who was dining here a few weeks ago was so struck
with the flavour, that I gave him a dozen of
them—put ’em in an empty box, and he took them with
him.”</p>

<p>“Indeed. Who was he?”</p>

<p>And the Canon replied dryly, a twinkle in his eye:</p>

<p>“The Dean!”</p>

<p>Colson waited till he got outside the house. Then
he said what he thought:</p>

<p>“Damn these parsons!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII. <br> Sir James Perrivale’s Story</h2>

<p>The advertisement inquiring for news of the
whereabouts of Ezra Grice, some time of Frattenbury,
was duly inserted in <i>The Times</i> and other
daily papers. The Chief Constable demurred a little
at first, but finally agreed with Colson that there
might be something in it, although, after the lapse
of such a long period, the discovery of the individual
in question had many chances against it.</p>

<p>At the end of the week Colson had a letter from
Anthony Crosby, in which he said:</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p>My advertisement for any correspondents of
  the late Mr. Templeton has had few results, and
  I send you them for what they are worth. I
  have, for convenience’s sake, tabulated them as
  follows:</p>

  <p>1. Two letters written to friends at his club—one
  from Salcombe and another from Poole—ordinary
  letters stating he was shortly coming up to
  London.</p>

  <p>2. Four letters to tradesmen, ordering certain
  goods.</p>

  <p>3. A letter to the editor of a magazine of
  travel, arranging for the publication of an article.</p>

  <p>Neither of these, for I have made inquiries,
  refers to the matter of Ezra Grice. We may,
  therefore, build upon the elimination theory, and
  presume that if the recipient of the letter has
  seen my advertisement he prefers to say nothing
  about it.</p>

  <p>I notice that you are advertising for this man
  Grice. If it will help you, I am willing to offer a
  reward of £50 for information which may
  produce him. Pray use your discretion in this
  matter when you re-advertise.</p>

  <p>I think I have now succeeded in piecing
  together the whole of the blotting-pad letter. You
  have probably arrived at a similar conclusion.
  Some may be guess-work, but I am inclined to
  believe that it reads thus:</p>

  <p>“hand over Ezra Grice’s confession &amp; proof.</p>

  <p>This is final.”</p>

  <p>Of course it is only a bit of the whole letter,
  but it is not without interest.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The police were debating as to whether they
should take advantage of the lawyer’s offer of the
reward, when a tall, weather-beaten individual, with
a close-cropped moustache, got out of the London
train at Frattenbury and inquired his way to the
police head-quarters. He was dressed in a loose
knickerbocker suit of excellent West End cut, and
walked with the air of a man of resource and
authority. He sent in his card and asked to see the
superintendent of police.</p>

<p>“Sir James Perrivale,” read the superintendent.
“The name seems familiar. Show him in, Peters.”</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said Sir James. “I’ve called
about that advertisement—you know, what?”</p>

<p>“Advertisement?”</p>

<p>“The what-d’ye-call-it—that fellow named Grice.
I saw the thing in my club yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Pray sit down, Sir James. We shall be glad
if you can give us any information about him.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Superintendent, I want to know what
you want him for. Anything against him? The
poor devil’s gone through enough already. What?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know anything against him, but we
certainly want to find out about him.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it down here somewhere that poor
Templeton was murdered?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir James—about two miles off.”</p>

<p>“Queer coincidence, what? Perhaps that’s what
you want him for?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand, Sir James.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, I thought perhaps you knew Grice
was with him in South Africa.”</p>

<p>“Was he, by George?” exclaimed the superintendent.
“We never knew that. We only wish we
had more details about Mr. Templeton; it might
help us. Do you know anything?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, no! Only I knew Templeton—over
the water, and Grice too, and I was interested,
what?”</p>

<p>“Will you tell us what you know?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will. Want me to make a statement?
All right. Well, I’ve only just got back
from South Africa. Been doing a bit of big-game
shooting up country—I’m speaking of three or four
months ago. I had a camp up beyond the Umbrati
river, and Templeton struck it. He was on his way
back. Queer chap, you know. Used to go and
bury himself for a couple o’ years in the
interior—exploring. Well, as I was saying, he struck our
camp. He was in a pretty low way, too, only a
few of his natives and this chap Grice left—very
little ammunition. Clothes like a scarecrow.”</p>

<p>“What was Grice doing with him?”</p>

<p>“He’d taken him, see? Grice had been in the
country years—Boer War, trading, diamond finding,
ivory—all sorts of things. Sort o’ chap down on
his luck and then up again. But he knew a lot—he
was a useful man. Spoke most of the dialects
and understood handling natives. Templeton picked
him up at Johannesburg, and got him to go with
him. Poor wretch! Never thought he’d bring him
back.”</p>

<p>“What was the matter?”</p>

<p>“Lots. Broken arm, fever, and all sorts of
complications. They’d had to carry him on a stretcher
for a week or more. Thin as a lath. I had a few
drugs—they’d nothing left—and did what I could.
But he looked like pegging out pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Did he?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. Templeton, you see, was in a
hurry to get on. Don’t wonder. Grice was at
death’s door, and he had to leave him. There was
something or other first—Grice’s will, I fancy.
Anyhow, Templeton was with him a long time the
day before he left, and then called me and
Ottery—Colonel Ottery, you know, who was shooting with
me—to witness Grice’s signature.</p>

<p>“The next morning Templeton left. We’d rigged
him out a bit, and gave him what we could spare.
We knew he’d be all right. I promised him I’d give
Grice a decent burial.”</p>

<p>“And——”</p>

<p>“No, we didn’t. One of my men—Zulu, he
was—asked to take him in hand—uncle had been a
medicine man, and he knew something about it,
what? Queer things they know sometimes about
herbs and so on, pretend they’re magic, of course.
The poor wretch was so far gone that it didn’t
seem to matter, so I let the chap take him in hand.
Poured a scalding hot drink down his throat, put
white powder in his eyes—rubbed him down—all
sorts of things. But it answered. Before we broke
up that camp, Superintendent, Grice was walking
about again.”</p>

<p>“What happened to him?”</p>

<p>“I brought him down to Cape Town and set him
on his legs. He’d got a bit of cash. Templeton
had paid him a lump sum down before he took him,
and he’d banked it. Anyhow, he said he should
stay at Cape Town for a bit till he was strong
again—so there he is.”</p>

<p>“Sir James,” said the superintendent, “I’m most
greatly obliged to you—more than I can say. But
we must have Grice here—as soon as possible. How
shall we get him?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t a charge against him?”</p>

<p>“No, no. It’s not a question of bringing him
over on an extradition warrant. He must come of
his own accord. We want him at once. But there’s
a difficulty.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, eh?”</p>

<p>“He left this town twenty years ago, when he
got into trouble. He was not prosecuted, but it
might make him suspicious.”</p>

<p>Sir James Perrivale thought a moment.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Superintendent, in confidence, of
course, is it anything to do with Templeton’s
murder, because it looks like it to me, what?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. Grice may help us materially in
getting on the track of our man. That’s why we want
him.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what, then. I always liked Templeton—queer
chap though he was. I’ll help you. Grice
will listen to me. I’ll cable for him to come over by
the next boat—and cable him the passage.”</p>

<p>“If it’s a question of expense, Sir James——”</p>

<p>“No, no. I’d like to. Leave it to me. I’ll get
him for you. And now I’m here you might do
something for me. I’ve read about the murder, of
course. How can I get to the place to have a look
at it? Morbid curiosity, what?”</p>

<p>“I’ll run you down now in a car, with pleasure.”</p>

<p>When they arrived at Marsh Quay it was peaceful
enough. The tide was in, bathed in a sunshine
splendour. Sir James remarked:</p>

<p>“Queer, isn’t it? Here’s this chap Templeton,
risked his life over and over again, all sorts of
adventures, escapes, and so on, and he gets done
to death in a quiet, beautiful spot like this—in the
midst of our civilisation, what? Gad, I wonder who
did it? I mustn’t ask what you know?”</p>

<p>“You may ask, Sir James. But I can’t tell
you—only—I think things are beginning to move. Did
you know Mr. Templeton well?”</p>

<p>“Met him several times—here and abroad,” said
Sir James, as they turned away from the water’s
edge. “Nobody knew him well; he wasn’t that
sort. And nobody I ever met could turn him if
he’d once made up his mind to do a thing—and he
did queer things at times. If he thought a course
was right, he’d stick to it—conventionality and
advice and prudence be damned! I shouldn’t wonder
if it wasn’t something of this kind that brought
that knife into his heart.”</p>

<p>Sir James went away, promising to let the
superintendent know how things were shaping, and the
latter rang up Colson, who was in his house. He
went to the police station at once, and listened
attentively to the story, but made little comment.</p>

<p>He was still working more or less in the dark and
was puzzled. But he acknowledged that the
prospect was brighter.</p>

<p>As he went up the street afterwards, he met
Francis Norwood coming out of the bank. The
lawyer stopped him.</p>

<p>“Well, sergeant. I’ve seen your advertisements.
Have you found Ezra Grice?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Colson truthfully, for he had not
found him.</p>

<p>“I see. Well, as I said before—anything I can
do, you know.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>The detective stood, lost in thought, as Norwood
went on his way—looking at him. Then he shook
his head slowly, went back to the police station,
asked for the copy of the proceedings at the inquest,
took it home and studied it till his wife literally
dragged him out of his chair to come to the meal.
But he was very silent as he ate, and as soon as
the meal was over, returned to his perusal of the
report. Then he took out his notebook and made
quite long entries.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX. <br> Colson Makes an Appointment</h2>

<p>Anthony Crosby, busy man as he was, found
a little time to follow up, from a natural curiosity,
the strange letter that Reginald Templeton had
addressed to him. As the letter had surmised, this
was not very difficult to do. He consulted several
old law lists, and made certain inquiries at the office
of the Law Society in Chancery Lane.</p>

<p>The result was that he went to the newspaper
reading-room, of the British Museum, where he had
a reader’s ticket, applied for files of newspapers
twenty years old, and very soon made himself
acquainted with the charge that had been brought
against Winnie’s father all those years ago. He
shook his head as he read the case—embezzlement
of clients’ monies.</p>

<p>“No wonder Templeton advised her mother to
keep it from the girl,” he murmured. “No—there
is no occasion to tell her now—— Hallo! That’s
curious!”</p>

<p>He read on carefully, then gave back the file of
papers to the attendant. As he walked away he
said to himself:</p>

<p>“This chap Ezra Grice is a bit of a puzzle. I
wonder what Templeton knew about him? I think
I’ll run down to Frattenbury and have a talk with
the Chief Constable; it’s better than writing. I
can do it without mentioning Winnie Cotterill, of
course. She mustn’t come in.”</p>

<p>Walking down Kingsway he met a friend of his,
a stockbroker whom he had not seen for some time,
and invited him to a cup of tea at a neighbouring
restaurant. In the course of conversation the broker
remarked:</p>

<p>“I was saying something to my partner this
morning not very complimentary to your profession,
Crosby.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“That the three classes of persons who make
fools of themselves in finance are lawyers, parsons
and old women.”</p>

<p>“That’s not kind,” said Crosby with a laugh.</p>

<p>“It’s true, though. We’ve had a big slump in
the mining market to-day—‘Virginian Reefs.’ You
haven’t got any, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Not I!”</p>

<p>“You’re lucky. They’ve gone down to three or
four shillings—if you can get a bid. Now, look
here, Crosby. I’m ready to bet you a new hat
that you’ll find a lot of old women and parsons and
lawyers—not one of ’em knowing anything about
mines—well hit over the job. I’ve bought myself,
for a country vicar and the curate of a seaside
town—and the biggest order I had for ‘Virginian Reefs’
came from a lawyer—a chap who won’t take my
advice.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“That’s not a fair question. Staid old chap,
living in a cathedral town—Frattenbury. I’ve had a
frantic wire from him to sell out, but there aren’t
bidders for all the lot he holds. Well, he’s wealthy,
and can afford to drop a bit. Good-bye, old chap.
I must be off.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Down in quiet, sleepy Frattenbury the superintendent
received a wire that day from Sir James
Perrivale:</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p>E. G. started from Cape. Boat due Plymouth
  December 8.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“It’s a waiting game, sir, then, for a few weeks,”
said Colson, to whom the superintendent showed
the wire. “But I want a little time.”</p>

<p>“Your week’s up, and more,” said the other.
“Have you anything to tell the chief? He’s getting
restive.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Colson. “I can tell him enough
to keep him quiet—though I’ve several things to
see to before I can satisfy him. I’m just off for a
final visit to Marsh Quay. There’s a question I
want to ask that little blighter, Proctor, which has
only just occurred to me.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>But Colson only shook his head, and started forth
on his bicycle. The little man grinned at him when
he was shown into his house at Marsh Quay.</p>

<p>“Come to arrest me again?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Proctor, I haven’t. But I want to ask
you something. Just carry your mind back to the
inquest. Do you remember how that cigar band
went round the jury?”</p>

<p>“Yes—perfectly. The Canon gave it to the coroner
and he handed it to the jury. Nine of them
had it before it came to me. I handed it over to the
two others—across the table—and they returned
it to the coroner.”</p>

<p>“Yes—that’s so. Then I suppose you recognised
that band across the table—or somehow—before it
got to you?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. It was only when I found it in
my hand that I recognised it. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Then why the dickens did you get ready to
change it before you knew what it was?”</p>

<p>“<em>Change</em> it!” exclaimed Proctor. “What are you
talking about? I never changed it!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried the detective, springing from his
seat. “Do you mean to tell me you never——”
He stopped suddenly. “Good Lord!” he said,
sitting down in his chair again.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Proctor.</p>

<p>The detective thought rapidly.</p>

<p>“One of those two jurymen must have changed
it,” he said. “It was another band we found we
had afterwards. For heaven’s sake keep your mouth
shut about it, Mr. Proctor.”</p>

<p>“The jurymen. What—Bailey or Westall? They
were the two. Why, my dear sir, Bailey is a most
respectable man—so is Westall.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a respectable man we’re after, Mr.
Proctor. It’s a murderer. Remember, we even
suspected <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t believe——”</p>

<p>“Don’t try, sir, don’t try. Promise me you’ll
say nothing, now. It mustn’t get out till we’ve
investigated.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll say nothing. But you astound
me.”</p>

<p>“I’m astounded myself,” said Colson, “though I
really ought not to be. Good day, Mr.
Proctor—mum’s the word, remember.”</p>

<p>He rushed back to Frattenbury and called at the
Deanery. To his question, the maid informed him
the Dean was abroad, and wouldn’t be back till the
first week in December. His language, as he came
away, concerning clergy in general and Cathedral
dignitaries in particular, was awful.</p>

<p>For two hours that evening he was closeted with
the Chief Constable and the superintendent. All
three men were exceedingly grave. Major Renshaw
said at length:</p>

<p>“We must get all the evidence, Colson. It’s an
awful thing, if it’s true. How about that stick!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to have to use it till we’ve proved
the rest, sir. He might slip out of our hands on
that alone.”</p>

<p>“Also, there’s Ezra Grice,” said the
superintendent.</p>

<p>“Yes—there’s Ezra Grice,” repeated the Chief
Constable. “We’ll wait for him.”</p>

<hr>

<p>As the weeks went by, Frattenbury and the
newspapers forgot all about the murder. There were
other matters for local gossip. People hinted that
Francis Norwood was getting closer than ever with
his cash. He demanded payments almost before
he gave advice or transacted business. He sold
a block of cottages belonging to him. And sundry
creditors began to say they wished he was as ready
to pay his bills as he was to be paid.</p>

<p>The Dean returned from his trip to the Riviera,
and Colson called on him again. This time he came
out of the Deanery evoking blessings on the heads of
the clergy, instead of curses. There was another
long conference between the three policemen—and
their faces were graver than ever. Colson watched
the shipping news anxiously, and one day took himself
off to Plymouth, returning with a sallow-faced
man who joined the trio at a further conference
that evening—and it was very late when Colson
took the stranger to his own house—where Mrs.
Colson had a spare room ready for him.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, then,” the Chief Constable had said,
when Colson left, and Colson had repeated the
words.</p>

<p>In the morning, the detective, who was carrying
the stick he had found in the dinghy, met Canon
Fittleworth. He stopped him.</p>

<p>“In confidence, sir,” he said, “I shall have some
news to tell you this evening—about your late
cousin. Shall you be at home?”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said the Canon, much interested.
“Let me see—I’m alone in the house, and I’ve asked
Mr. Norwood to dine with me—at half-past seven.
Can you come about an hour earlier?”</p>

<p>A smile lingered on the detective’s face, and he
replied:</p>

<p>“Mr. Norwood might like to hear my news as
well. Should I be intruding at—say nine o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Come, by all means.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir—you won’t mention this to Mr.
Norwood?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t want me to.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>Colson, after this interview, did not pursue his
way up the street. Instead, he retraced it to the
police station.</p>

<p>“Better still, by and by,” he remarked.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock he was walking up the street
again, carrying the stick. He rang the bell of a
quiet house in a quiet street. He was about five
minutes inside that house, and then he went back
to the police station, outwardly calm, but inwardly
realising that this was the most intense moment of
his life.</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly true, sir,” he said to the Chief
Constable, holding out the walking-stick.</p>

<p>The Chief Constable sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, “then there’s nothing more
to say about it.”</p>

<p>A little before nine the three policemen, and the
stranger staying in Colson’s house, walked up the
South Street together, and disappeared through the
gateway half-way up the street into the quiet regions
of the Cathedral Close.</p>

<p>“I ordered the taxi, sir,” said Colson. “It will
be all ready—outside the house—about half-past
nine.”</p>

<p>Major Renshaw nodded in silence. He was
feeling the situation acutely.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch20">

<h2>CHAPTER XX. <br> Colson’s “Imagination”</h2>

<p>The maid who opened the door looked a little
surprised when she found herself confronted with
the four men.</p>

<p>“I think the Canon is engaged,” she began, “he
has someone——”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s expecting us—one of us, at least,” said
the Chief Constable. “I think he’ll see us. Who
is with him?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Norwood, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well, will you show us in, please? Except
this gentleman—he will wait in the hall.”</p>

<p>The Canon rose from his seat as the three
policemen entered. Neither of them was in uniform.
Major Renshaw, a punctilious man, wore evening
dress. He always dressed for dinner.</p>

<p>Francis Norwood, seated in an arm-chair near the
fire, also rose when he saw Major Renshaw. The
Canon held out his hand in greeting.</p>

<p>“This is a surprise,” he said; “I hardly
expected——”</p>

<p>“You must forgive this intrusion, Canon,”
interrupted the Chief Constable. “Sergeant Colson
mentioned that he was going to see you this evening,
and we’ve taken the liberty of coming with him.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he did not take the Canon’s proffered
hand. Instead, he bowed stiffly to him and Francis
Norwood—who sat down once more. Indeed, the
whole attitude of Major Renshaw savoured of
officialism. The Canon apparently, noticed it. He
stiffened slightly.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down?” he asked.</p>

<p>The Chief Constable and the superintendent took
the chairs he offered near the middle of the room.
Colson, who had one hand behind his back, sat
down in a chair near the door. When he had done
so, he stooped to lay down his hat and stick, which
he placed on the floor, behind a sofa.</p>

<p>“If I’m in the way, Fittleworth——” began
Norwood.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” broke in the Chief Constable; “don’t
let us disturb you.”</p>

<p>Canon Fittleworth sat down again, wiped his
pince-nez with his handkerchief, and adjusted them
on his nose, and said, addressing the Major:</p>

<p>“Well now, Major, I don’t know the purpose of
your visit, but can only presume you have some
news to impart. Is it about my late cousin?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is—something you ought to know.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said the Canon, “Mr. Norwood
will be interested too.”</p>

<p>Norwood nodded his head slightly, and said in
his judicial manner:</p>

<p>“Naturally. My business with the unhappy affair
ended, of course, with the verdict that was returned.
But, as a private individual, I may be allowed some
curiosity. Is there anything fresh, Major?”</p>

<p>“There is,” said the Chief Constable, but
addressing his remarks to the Canon as he spoke.
“Detective-Sergeant Colson, as you know, has had
the case in hand, and I’m going to ask you to let
him tell you in his own way.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Canon to Colson, “we shall
be pleased to hear you.”</p>

<p>Colson’s face flushed slightly; he glanced round
the room, and finally fixed his gaze on Canon
Fittleworth. It was some moments before he
began—the Chief Constable had even to say to him:</p>

<p>“Go on, Colson.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said Colson, addressing the Canon,
and never looking at anyone else, “this has not been
an easy case at all, and I don’t mind confessing
that I’ve blundered considerably.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done your best, sergeant, I’m sure. And
no man can do more.”</p>

<p>It was Norwood who spoke, but Colson took no
notice of him. He only seemed to be aware of Canon
Fittleworth’s presence. He went on:</p>

<p>“My initial mistake, which led to others, was in
taking it for granted that robbery was the motive
for the murder—I allude to the diamonds. There
were three persons who came under suspicion—there
were ugly facts against each of them, especially
as one of them was possessed of cigars of the same
brand as those which you smoke, sir. And, in spite
of the band being changed—or, rather, because of
it—we felt quite sure that this individual was our
man.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by the cigar band being
changed?” asked Norwood.</p>

<p>But the detective never removed his eyes from the
Canon.</p>

<p>“Yes—it was changed,” he said. “I’ll come to
that later on. Well, as I was saying, these three
men were cleared of all complicity with the crime.
As for your cigars, Canon Fittleworth”—and he
took a paper from his pocket—“I have a list here
of all the persons to whom you gave any of those
particular cigars, and I am satisfied that not one of
them committed the murder, or knew anything about
it.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to hear that,” said the Canon, a
little uncomfortably, for the detective’s fixed gaze
was beginning to fascinate him strangely.</p>

<p>“It’s true,” went on Colson. “Well, the time came
when I dismissed from my mind the idea that the
robbery of the diamonds was the motive. I had
to begin all over again. And now, Canon Fittleworth,
I want to tell you how I imagine in my own
mind that your cousin was done to death.”</p>

<p>“Do you <em>know</em>?”</p>

<p>“I said ‘imagine,’ sir. Few people have ever
witnessed the actual committal of a murder. Mr.
Templeton, I think, was killed because he was a
very foolish man. I would go so far as to say that
he probably brought it on himself.”</p>

<p>“But——” began the Canon.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” said the detective, holding up his
hand, “let me tell my story in my own way. I want
you to follow your cousin’s movements in your mind
from the time he left this house on the Saturday
night.”</p>

<p>“This is all imagination, I think you said?” asked
Francis Norwood.</p>

<p>“This is all imagination, yes. But imagination
often helps to reconstruct a crime. Well, sir, he
left your house to keep an appointment.”</p>

<p>“With whom?” asked the Canon.</p>

<p>“Ah,” replied Colson, “there is no one to tell us
that. There were no witnesses, we will suppose.
Imagination, sir! He kept the appointment then.
In Frattenbury. As this is imagination, we will call
the person with whom he had an appointment ‘Mr.
Blank.’ The end of this appointment was, that he
and ‘Mr. Blank’ walked back together to Marsh
Quay.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the Canon.</p>

<p>“Probably—for I don’t know—because your
cousin asked him to go,” said Colson. “I told you
he was a very foolish man. I believe he had faced
many dangers in the course of his life, but he was
never in so much danger as when he took that walk
back to his yacht. Shall I tell you the way the two
men went? Yes? Imagination, remember, sir!
Well, they didn’t start along the well-lighted South
Street. They went down the parallel street—only
two lamps in it, sir—and hardly a soul there at
that time of night. Then they went on to the Canal
Basin—‘Mr. Blank’ had chosen the route—turned
sharply to the right, crossed the main road, and
took the field path leading to Marsh Quay.</p>

<p>“When they reached the shore your cousin pulled
‘Mr. Blank’ out to the yacht in his dinghy. ‘Mr.
Blank’ was smoking a cigar at the time—or lighted
it when he got on board the yacht.”</p>

<p>“Why do you imagine that my cousin took him
on board?”</p>

<p>“My fancy, sir, if you like. Let us say that there
was something on board which your cousin had
promised to show ‘Mr. Blank’—or to give to him.
And as soon as he produced it, ‘Mr. Blank,’ who,
I think, must have armed himself with a weapon
for the purpose, killed your cousin.”</p>

<p>“But why——”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment, sir. Hear me out. ‘Mr. Blank,’
who had not noticed that the band had dropped
off his cigar, very quickly relieved your cousin of
any papers he had on him—we will imagine there
was a reason for this—then he rowed ashore in the
dinghy and did a very curious thing—it puzzled
my imagination—at first. But I thought out a
reason for it. He got hold of a canoe and took
the dinghy back to the yacht again, making her
fast, and finally paddled himself to shore in the
canoe and walked back to Frattenbury, where he
let himself into his house before, we will imagine,
the theatrical performance at the Town Hall was
quite over. Well, sir, <em>that’s</em> my theory of how your
cousin was murdered.”</p>

<p>He paused. The Chief Constable and the
superintendent sat like two statues. Francis Norwood
leaned a little forward in his chair, and remarked,
with a touch of sarcasm:</p>

<p>“A very lucid story, sergeant. I hope you may
be successful in tracking down this ‘Mr. Blank.’ ”</p>

<p>But, again ignoring the coroner, Colson went
on—to the Canon:</p>

<p>“What do you think of it, sir?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think. It’s so very strange.
But, to confine ourselves to your definition, can you
imagine the motive?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Colson, very quietly. “I think
I can.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“Something that the law would call by a very ugly
name—‘blackmail.’ That’s what I think, sir.”</p>

<p>“Blackmail!—this ‘Mr. Blank’?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Mr. Templeton!”</p>

<p>“My cousin a blackmailer!” exclaimed Canon
Fittleworth. “Preposterous!”</p>

<p>“I said that’s what the law would call him, sir.
Please—let me go on. I haven’t quite finished. Let
me imagine something further.”</p>

<p>For the first time since he had begun to speak,
he took his eyes off the Canon, and gave a rapid
glance at Superintendent Norton. Then he looked
at the Canon again.</p>

<p>“What I am about to imagine now,” he said slowly,
“is first that the Dean gave ‘Mr. Blank’ one of the
Canon’s cigars, secondly that ‘Mr. Blank’ was a
left-handed man, and thirdly that he made one
fatal mistake—he left his walking-stick in the
dinghy—and this is it!”</p>

<p>He lifted the walking-stick, suddenly, from
behind the sofa and held it out to the Canon. Then
he turned in a flash, and sprang across the room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Norwood, I arrest you for the murder of
Reginald Templeton.”</p>

<p>There was a flash of steel and a click. Francis
Norwood, who had risen to his feet when Colson
had darted towards him, stood there, the handcuffs
on his wrist.</p>

<p>“Damn you!” he exclaimed, for once losing his
frigidity. “What do you mean? That isn’t my
stick. I had one like it, it is true, but I know that
isn’t mine—I——”</p>

<p>“Norwood,” broke in the Chief Constable sternly,
“it is my duty to warn you that anything you say
will be taken down and may be given in evidence.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> your stick,” said Colson gravely. “Your
housekeeper recognised it this evening. I’ve had it
from the first. The one you removed from the
dinghy the next night was a dummy. I put it there.”</p>

<p>The astonished Canon looked from one to the
other, and exclaimed to Major Renshaw:</p>

<p>“Is this—is this extraordinary action
countenanced by <em>you</em>, Major?”</p>

<p>“I fear it is, Canon,” replied Major Renshaw.
“Knowing what we do—and there is a great deal
more—I have no option in the matter.”</p>

<p>“But this is terrible—terrible!”</p>

<p>Francis Norwood, still deadly pale, recovered a
little from the shock.</p>

<p>“This is unpardonable of you, Major Renshaw.
I demand an explanation.”</p>

<p>“Colson will give you one, Mr. Norwood. But I
fear it will not help you.”</p>

<p>He nodded to the detective, who opened the door.
A thin, white-faced, emaciated man came into the
room. Norwood regarded him with horror.</p>

<p>“Ezra Grice!” he exclaimed in a low voice. “I—I
thought he was dead!”</p>

<p>“I know you did,” said Colson, “or you wouldn’t
have been so eager to help with that advertisement.
Shall I ask Grice to tell his story?”</p>

<p>“No—no,” said the lawyer. “No—yes—I don’t
care if he does. It’s all a pack of lies, and he can’t
prove anything.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter whether he can or not,” said
Colson. “I haven’t arrested you because of
something you did twenty years ago. You are charged
with murder—not embezzlement. May I go on,
sir?” he asked the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>“It is irregular, Colson,” said the Major stiffly.</p>

<p>“I should very much like to know more,” put in
the bewildered Canon. “I think I have a right to
ask. You’ve arrested one of my friends in my own
house—charged with the murder of my cousin.
Norwood,” and he went up to the lawyer, “won’t you
tell me you didn’t do this awful thing? I can’t
believe it!”</p>

<p>“You’ve heard what Major Renshaw said,” replied
Norwood. “Anything I say may incriminate
me. I have no desire to discuss the matter further
at this point.”</p>

<p>“We owe you a further explanation, Canon, as
you say,” remarked the Chief Constable, “and with
your permission, Colson shall remain—and Mr.
Grice.”</p>

<p>The Canon nodded.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said. “They may stay.”</p>

<p>“Come!” said the superintendent. Between him
and the Chief Constable the coroner walked out of
the room, and a motor was heard a few moments
later. Canon Fittleworth sat down and buried his
head in his hands. Presently he said:</p>

<p>“I’m thankful my wife and daughter are not at
home.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have happened here, sir, if they
had been, I assure you. You told me, you know,
that you were alone.”</p>

<p>The Canon nodded.</p>

<p>“Go on,” he said. “I want to hear it all—poor
Reginald!”</p>

<p>“It’s a long story, sir, but I’ll try to make it as
short as possible. The first idea that set me on
the right track was that the murderer was a
left-handed man. I found out that Mr. Templeton did
not walk with a stick—I mean, didn’t put the point
to the ground. There were square tracks of the
stick’s ferrule on the path to Marsh Quay, on the
left side as you go out.”</p>

<p>“But what made you suspect the stick had
anything to do with it?”</p>

<p>Colson told him how the dummy one had been
removed on the night after the murder, and then
went on.</p>

<p>“I was on the look-out for a left-handed man,
and one day I saw Mr. Norwood draw a cork from
a bottle. He held the bottle with his right hand and
drew it with his left. It seemed preposterous, but
when I noticed him another day walking down the
street with a stick in his left hand it set me
thinking. I got the report of the inquest, and studied
it carefully, noting all the coroner’s questions. And
it seemed to me that he was particularly anxious
to find out whether anyone had an idea as to your
cousin’s appointment. Also, when Jim Webb mentioned
that he had read the address on the letter
to you, he questioned him narrowly as to whether
he had read any other addresses. Then he must
have felt secure until you produced that cigar band.
I thought for a long time that Proctor had changed
it, but when I found he hadn’t, I knew it could
only have been the coroner himself.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“There were several old bands off cigars that had
been smoked by Grayson, lying in the grate. Don’t
you remember that the coroner dropped some papers
in the grate, and stooped down to get them? So did
Proctor. That’s why I suspected him first. Afterwards
I saw it all. While that cigar band was passing
round the jury, the coroner picked up one from the
grate and changed it. Clever! But it was a foolish
thing to do, as it turned out.</p>

<p>“You told me you gave a dozen of your cigars
to the Dean. He remembered that when Norwood
was dining with him afterwards—just a day or two
before the murder—he smoked one of them, and
liked it so much that the Dean gave him a couple,
which he put in his case.</p>

<p>“Well, in Norwood’s hall, when I went to see
him one day, I noticed several queer photographs
and old weapons—three or four small daggers among
them—hanging on the wall. Then Mr. Crosby was
a great help; he put me on the track of finding Ezra
Grice. There was a letter partly blotted on Mr.
Templeton’s blotting-pad that gave us the clue. And
Mr. Crosby also found out the beginning of the
whole story, and accidentally discovered that the
coroner was speculating heavily—and that had a
lot to do with things. He wanted money.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said the Canon. “I imagined him to
be a wealthy man.”</p>

<p>“So did most people, sir, but after what we heard
we made inquiries, and found out a lot about him.
And I assure you that even if I hadn’t arrested
him to-night, he’d very soon have been in the
bankruptcy court.”</p>

<p>“You astonish me.”</p>

<p>“It’s true, sir. Now, when our friend Ezra Grice
here arrived from South Africa, he solved the rest
of the mystery. We have his sworn statement. Will
you tell the Canon, Mr. Grice?”</p>

<p>Grice, who had not spoken hitherto, said:</p>

<p>“Yes, I will. Where shall I begin?”</p>

<p>“At the beginning—twenty years ago.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find it a strange story, sir,” said Colson.
“And it will explain why I said the law would have
called your cousin a blackmailer.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI. <br> Final Solution of the Problem</h2>

<p>It was an extraordinary story that Ezra Grice
had to tell. Briefly, the first part of it amounted
to this. Twenty years ago he had been clerk in
Francis Norwood’s office. Norwood, at that time,
had a partner, a young married man named Forbes.
Forbes was tried on a charge of embezzlement, and
Grice was a witness for the prosecution. But Grice
was deeply involved himself. Addicted to betting,
he had helped himself to the firm’s
money—falsifying accounts.</p>

<p>Just before the trial commenced he made a
discovery—a discovery that would have proved Forbes
an innocent man. And the discovery he made was
that Norwood himself, who had been speculating
heavily, had embezzled the money from two clients—and
not Forbes at all. Knowing this, he went into
Norwood’s private office and accused him of the
crime.</p>

<p>But Norwood turned the tables on him. To
Grice’s horror, he calmly produced proofs of the
clerk’s defalcations, and threatened to give him in
charge instantly.</p>

<p>“And who is going to believe you <em>then</em>?” he asked
calmly. “Do you think they’ll take the word of a
thief against mine?”</p>

<p>Grice, who had no proofs in his possession at the
time, but had only arrived at his conclusions by a
study of accounts and documents passing through
his hands, was staggered. He felt he had matched
himself unwisely against the astute lawyer—who
was quick to see this.</p>

<p>“Very well,” Norwood had said, “you can take
your choice. Either I send for a policeman at once,
or you withdraw what you say, and give your
evidence to-morrow. Which is it to be? I give you
five minutes to decide.”</p>

<p>Ezra Grice decided before the five minutes were
up. He caved in, abjectly. As soon as the trial
was over, and Forbes was sentenced, Norwood coolly
told him that unless he left Frattenbury at once
and never returned, he would prosecute him for
theft.</p>

<p>“And if I say what I know?” asked Grice.</p>

<p>“They won’t believe you if you do; and if they
do believe you, then you’ll be prosecuted for perjury
as well.”</p>

<p>Again the wretched clerk gave in. But before he
left the office that very day he made a fresh
discovery—a paper which Norwood had left out of his
safe that absolutely incriminated him. He was half
inclined to make use of this paper and have his
revenge on the wily lawyer, but fear got the better
of him. However, when he left Frattenbury the
next day he took this paper with him and kept it
carefully.</p>

<p>He went out to South Africa and led a roving
life for years keeping honest all the time. He had
had one great fright, and that was enough for him.
He always kept the incriminating paper; he was in
dread that perhaps one day his crime might follow
him, and he looked upon it as a weapon of defence
in case he ever met Norwood again. Finally, as
Sir James Perrivale had said, he joined Reginald
Templeton in an exploration in the interior.</p>

<p>“It was a long time,” he went on to the Canon,
“before I told Mr. Templeton my story—and he
was the only man to whom I ever told it before
the police took it down here. I happened to
mention Frattenbury one day, and he questioned me,
but I didn’t let him know anything then. However,
I saw he knew something about the Forbes case
and was interested in it.</p>

<p>“Then he saved my life. I got to like him. He
was a queer man, but very kind to me always. I
shall never forget how he stood by me on that
awful journey before we struck Sir James
Perrivale’s camp. My arm was broken and I was down
with fever. He’d help to carry the stretcher
himself—miles at a time.</p>

<p>“I asked him point-blank one day if he was
interested in Forbes. He only answered ‘Yes.’ Then
I said, ‘Would it be any use to you to know he was
innocent of that charge?’ I shan’t forget what he
said. He questioned me eagerly and I told him all
about it. Then he said, ‘Thank God for this, Grice.
Forbes died long ago; but he’s left a daughter—and,
by God, that scoundrel Norwood shall make
it up to her!’</p>

<p>“He made me promise I’d go back to England
with him—if we ever came through—and help him
expose Norwood—or, rather, he said he was not
going to expose him—he’d got a better card to play
than that. But it seemed that I wasn’t going to
get back to England. They all thought me dying
when we got to the camp. Mr. Templeton had to
go on, but before he left he wrote down my statement
which I signed before witnesses, and asked me
to give him that paper I had on me. Of course I
did, and then he told me what he was going to do.
I can hear him saying it now.</p>

<p>“ ‘You’ll have your revenge on Norwood,’ he said.
‘And it’s a revenge that will touch him to the quick
on his sorest point. Forbes is dead, and we can’t
help him. And his wife is dead. But there’s her
daughter. If I were to give Norwood into the hands
of the law there’d be no recompense for <em>her</em>. But,
by God, there <em>shall</em> be! As soon as I get back
to the old country I shall write to Norwood, tell
him what I know, and offer him choice between
exposure and ten thousand pounds.’ ”</p>

<p>“That is where the blackmail comes in, sir,”
interposed Colson quietly. “And I don’t know that I
wouldn’t justify it—but the law wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Go on, please,” said the Canon to Grice.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, he went on to say that if he got this
sum out of Norwood he should settle it on Forbes’s
daughter—not telling her where it came from, and
not letting her know about her father. He said
she was only a child at the time—well, I knew that;
I’ve often seen her here—and that she had been
brought up in ignorance of her father’s crime.”</p>

<p>“I think I know who she was,” murmured the
Canon. “That accounts for those strange impressions
of having been here before—and recognising
Norwood. Yes?”</p>

<p>Ezra Grice finished the story, and the detective
took up the threads.</p>

<p>“Now do you see, sir?” he asked. “Mr. Templeton
evidently carried out his threat and wrote to
Norwood on his return. Then he made an appointment
with him. He wrote saying he was prepared
to hand over Grice’s confession and proofs in
exchange for the money. Norwood must have been
in a terrible dilemma. He must get those proofs
in any case; it would mean utter ruin to him if he
was once exposed. But he hadn’t the money to
buy them. Whether or not he meant to bluff your
cousin remains to be seen. Anyhow, he made the
appointment, and sent his domestics to the
performance at the Town Hall that night—I’ve found
out that—in order to be alone when Templeton
called.”</p>

<p>“But why go back to Marsh Quay with him?”
asked the Canon.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see, sir? I think we can guess.
Templeton hadn’t got the confession and proofs on
him. He made a mistake by being too careful. You
told us he said he was very likely going to spend
a few nights here. Very well. That particular night
he wasn’t prepared to hand them over. The coroner
had probably not committed himself, even by a
typewritten, unsigned letter. And he knew he hadn’t
the money.”</p>

<p>“What <em>did</em> he do, then?” asked the Canon.</p>

<p>“Probably pretended that he <em>had</em> got it, and induced
Templeton to give him the proofs that night.
By this time he had made up his mind that he <em>must</em>
have them—in any case. And I think he took that
dagger, or whatever it was, with him—ready to
take the biggest risk of all. Which we know he
did!”</p>

<p>Canon Fittleworth sat for a few minutes in silence.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“Thank you, Sergeant Colson, and thank you also,
Mr. Grice. The whole affair has been terrible—very
terrible. I want time to think it over. I must
say, however, Colson, that you are a very clever
man to have found out all this.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. I did my best. And someone
helped me very much. Good night, sir. I’m very
sorry all this has happened.”</p>

<p>Colson and Ezra Grice went out, leaving the
Canon seated in his chair gazing at the fire, his mind
greatly agitated.</p>

<hr>

<p>At the police station that night Norwood asked
to be provided with writing materials. They did so.</p>

<p>He smiled sardonically while they searched him and
took away a penknife and a pair of pocket
nail-scissors.</p>

<p>But in the morning they found him hanging to
the bar of the window—they have out-of-date cells
in Frattenbury—his braces substituted for the rope
that he would have eventually earned. And on the
table was a characteristic document:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>I am anxious to assist my successor, though I
  fancy he will have no trouble in persuading the
  jury as to the verdict. I am a ruined man, with
  no more use for the world. Sergeant Colson’s
  “imagination” is fairly correct. I will only add
  that I persuaded Templeton I had the money.
  He had demanded cash. I showed him what
  appeared to be a roll of notes—tissue-paper with
  some genuine ones at the top. I also told him
  that unless he gave me what Ezra Grice has
  probably described that night, I should
  abscond—with the ten thousand pounds on me. He made
  a mistake in not bringing what he had for
  sale—he was too cautious. It was the dagger hanging
  in my hall when I put my coat on that suggested
  I might have to take a desperate step. I took it
  with me. Templeton produced what I wanted
  from the locker. Then he was fool enough to
  examine the roll of notes I had laid on the table.
  That was the end of it. I took the contents of
  his pockets to make sure in case he had anything
  with my name on it. I desire to say that I regret
  what I did, but I was desperate that night. That
  is all.</p>

</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>“Mr. Crosby,” said the Canon the following
day—the lawyer had come down to Frattenbury on
receipt of a wire from the police—“I want to ask
you something.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“This girl, Winifred Cotterill—or Forbes, as we
must call her now. If there had been a trial, I
suppose everything would have come out?”</p>

<p>“About her father? Certainly. Ezra Grice would
have given evidence, and the girl must have guessed.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. As it is, however, she has never
heard about her father’s sufferings. Poor fellow,
what he must have gone through! The matter, you
