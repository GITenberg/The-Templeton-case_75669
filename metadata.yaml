summary: '"The Templeton Case" by Victor L. Whitechurch is a detective novel written
  in the early 20th century. The story opens in the quaint seaside village of Marsh
  Quay, where the characters and setting lay the foundation for a mystery involving
  murder, intrigue, and clues that weave together the lives of various individuals,
  particularly revolving around the enigmatic Reginald Templeton. Readers can expect
  to delve into a web of relationships and secrets as Detective-Sergeant Colson pursues
  the truth behind the crime.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Tom
  Gale, a laid-back crewman of a small schooner, and the arrival of Reginald Templeton
  on a yacht. Templeton''s engagement in boating and a mysterious visit across the
  estuary hint at deeper connections and potential motives. As Templeton''s fate takes
  a grim turn with his murder discovered soon after by his crew member, Jim Webb,
  the tension escalates. Characters like Mrs. Yates, the landlady of the "Marinerâ€™s
  Arms," and Mr. Proctor, a local gentleman, become entwined in the unfolding investigation.
  The narrative expertly sets the stage for a classic whodunit, promising misdirection
  and evolving clues as Detective-Sergeant Colson works diligently to untangle the
  mystery surrounding Templeton''s death. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
